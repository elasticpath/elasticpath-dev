**Minor** The `bundle_configuation` object was misspelled in the cart, cart items, and order items. Therefore, on October 18, 2022, we have deprecated `bundle_configuation` and recommend that you use `bundle_configuration` to create a bundle configuration. See [Carts](/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-items).
