**Major** Commerce Manager: You can now manage catalog releases from **Catalogs > Edit Catalog**. For more information, see [Editing Catalogs](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalogs-cm/catalog-configuration#editing-catalogs-and-catalog-releases).

**Minor** Fixed a bug where promotions to carts were applied even when start date of the promotions was in the future.

**Minor** You can now see price without discounted amount and all the discounts applied in the `meta` object in carts and order items. You can also see the promotion id generated for the promotion. For more information, see [Cart Items](/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-items) and [Order Items](/docs/commerce-cloud/orders/orders-api/order-items).
