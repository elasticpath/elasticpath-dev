**Minor** Account Management APIs are no longer in beta. You can now remove `account-management` and `account-authentication-settings` from the [Beta Header](/guides/Getting-Started/api-contract) and use the APIs in production environment. For more information, see [Account Management](/docs/api/accounts).
