**Major** You can now create Application Keys, which are tied to the actual store instead of a user. This is helpful in avoiding scenarios like when a user in your organization leaves, then their user-specific keys leave with them. For more information, see [Application Keys](/docs/commerce-cloud/authentication/security#application-keys).

Additionally, we have moved all keys and credentials to **Settings > Application Keys** section in Commerce Manager. For more information, see [Creating an Application Key](/docs/commerce-cloud/authentication/application-keys/application-keys-cm).

**Minor** Commerce Manager: A new **External Reference** field allows you to store another unique ID with your PXM product. This could be a unique ID from another company system, for example. See [Configuring Products in Product Experience Manager](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-cm/pxm-product-configuration).

**Minor** Commerce Manager: When searching for products in **Product Experience Manager** > **Products**, you can now search on **Description**, **UPC/EAN** and, **MPN**. This is in addition to **Slug**, **SKU** and, **Name**. See [Configuring Products in Product Experience Manager](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-cm/pxm-product-configuration).
