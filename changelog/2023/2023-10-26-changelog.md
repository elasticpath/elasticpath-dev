**MAJOR** When managing Application Keys, you now have the ability to specify the minimum number of requests per second that are allowed, reserving a rate limit for each key. This enables you to finely adjust the performance and availability of your applications that are integrated with our platform. For more information, see **[Application Keys Overview](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/authentication/application-keys/application-keys-overview)**.

Additionally, in Commerce Manager, we have added a new **Requests per second** field. This field allows you to enter the reserved rate limit for the key when **[Creating an Application Key](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/authentication/application-keys/application-keys-cm)**.

**MINOR** Commerce Manager: You can now generate a delta file with all the contents of a catalog release from Commerce Manager. For more information, see **[Using Catalog Delta Files.](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalogs-cm/publishing-catalogs#using-catalog-delta-files)**
