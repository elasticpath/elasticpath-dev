**MINOR** We have introduced a new optional field called **external\_ref** to the **[Accounts API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/accounts/using-account-management-api/account-management-api-overview)**. This field is designed to store external references from other company systems, enhancing seamless integration between our platform and external entities.

**MINOR** When the **auto\_create\_account\_for\_account\_members** field is enabled, the corresponding account has the account name and legal name of the created account member. This enhancement streamlines efficient filtering, making it easier to identify auto-created accounts. For more information, see **[Update Account Authentication Settings](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/authentication/single-sign-on/account-authentication-settings/update-account-authentication-settings)**.
