**Major**
You can now use the Elastic Path Commerce Cloud Store Configuration Orchestrator utility in the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager to export and/or import resources from one Elastic Path Commerce Cloud store to another. This is useful if, for example, you want to copy a configuration from a store in a development environment to a store in a production environment. See [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud Store Configuration Orchestrator](/docs/composer/integration-hub/store-management/store-configuration).

**Major**
Commerce Manager: You can dissociate products from multiple hierarchies and their nodes. For more information, see [Dissociating products from multiple nodes](/docs/pxm/hierarchies/hierarchy#dissociating-products-from-multiple-nodes).
