**MAJOR** Algolia â€“ Full/Delta/Large Catalog Integration: Added three new flows to the integration and configured a webhook in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud to synchronize inventory when the corresponding option is enabled. This connects the **s****tock\_transaction.created** event to the **Single Entry Inventory UpdateObject to Algolia Direct** flow**.** Depending on the configuration, the flow retrieves either **available** or **total** inventory and sends the data to all Algolia indexes. There is an option to skip object creation if they do not already exist in that particular index. In version 58, a third flow is introduced to cache Algolia Mapping, refreshing on an **hourly** by default. This eliminates the need to fetch the mapping with every stock update.

**MINOR** When creating, updating, or retrieving an address, you can now see customer or account relationship details linked to that address. This is helpful for getting webhook payloads.
