**MINOR** In Commerce Manager:

*   Removed store type label previously displayed next to store names, and replaced with **STORE** label instead to help distinguish from when a user is managing an Organization.
*   Added rate limit details for stores under **SYSTEM > Store Settings > General Settings**, which have been reorganized to group together related settings.

For more information, see **[General Settings in Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/settings/general-settings)**.
