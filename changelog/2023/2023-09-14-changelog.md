**MAJOR** You can now use the preview cart feature to set a future date for your shopping cart and view the promotions that will be available during that period. This feature enables you to validate your promotion settings and observe how they will be applied in the cart. For more information, see **[Create a Preview Cart](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-management/create-multi-cart#post-create-a-preview-cart)**.
