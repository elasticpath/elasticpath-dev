Commerce Manager: You can now see the nodes that products belong to in **Products**. For more information, see [Overview](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/overview#products-and-catalog-releases).

**Minor**
In Commerce Manager, when configuring pricing for a product, a new **Bundle Sales Prices** table shows you if this product has any sales prices across any of the bundles that the product belongs to. For more information, see [Configuring Product Price](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#adding-products-and-prices-to-a-price-book).
