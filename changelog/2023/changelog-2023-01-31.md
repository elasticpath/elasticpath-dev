**Major** 
Commerce Manager: You can now export products on the **Products** page to build the .csv file containing the product entries. For more information, see [Export PXM Products in Commerce Manager](/docs/pxm/products/exporting-products/export-products-cm)

**Minor** 
Commerce Manager: On the **Order details** page, you can now view custom inputs when adding custom items to the cart. This is useful, for example, when you open an order to see all the custom inputs for an order item. For more information about custom inputs, see [Add Custom Item to Cart](/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-items/add-custom-item-to-cart#personalized-products).
