You can now integrate Elastic Path Commerce Cloud with Advanced Commerce (GrapheneHC) using the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager. This means you can synchronize Elastic Path Commerce Cloud data such as products, prices, images, categories, custom attributes and variations with your Advanced Commerce (GrapheneHC) storefront, giving you advanced searching and merchandising capabilities.
