**MAJOR** We have introduced a new field called **auto\_add\_free\_gift** into the **[Free Gift Promotion](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotion-management/create-free-gift-promotion)** type where free gifts are automatically added to the shopping cart for all the eligible products. For more information, see **[Promotions Overview](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotions-overview)** section. This feature is still a work in progress.

Additionally, in Commerce Manager, we have also introduced the **Automatically add free gift items to the cart** toggle to add free gifts automatically to the shopping cart. For more information, see **[Creating Free Gift Promotions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotions-cm/item-level-promotions/free-gift-promotions)**.
