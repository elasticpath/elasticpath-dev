**MINOR** We have introduced a mechanism to allow you to influence the layout of Custom Fields within a Custom API in a User Interface. It does not order or affect the JSON response, and has no semantics on the backend. For more information, see [Creating Custom Fields](/docs/commerce-manager/commerce-extension/commerce-extension-in-cm#creating-custom-fields).
