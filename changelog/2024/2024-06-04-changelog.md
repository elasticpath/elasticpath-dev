**MINOR** The **Configure a Shopper Bundle** endpoint now supports using the **include** parameter to retrieve key attribute data for the products in a product bundle. This is useful because, when your shoppers select the products in the bundle that they want to purchase in your storefront, you can then display all the relevant product information to your shoppers. See **[Configure a Shopper Bundle](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/configure-by-context-product)**.

**MINOR** You can now configure the expiry time of Account Management Authentication Tokens to implement an idle timeout feature. For more information, see **[Implementing Idle Timeout](/guides/How-To/Accounts/implement-idle-timeout)**.

**MINOR** We have Introduced a new **eCommerce Admin** role with capabilities for PXM, promotions, orders and account management. For more information, see **[Store Roles](/guides/Getting-Started/team-management)**.
