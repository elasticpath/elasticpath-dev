**MINOR** We have introduced the ability to configure a Custom Field  as `immutable`, allowing you to better align your Custom API with your business needs. When set to true, the value of this field can be specified only during POST requests and cannot be modified during PUT requests. For more information, see [Custom Fields](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-fields#immutable).
