**MINOR** We have introduced the ability to configure a Custom API to allow a Custom API Entry to be created if it didn't exist when attemping to update it. This simplifies business procceses such as data import and synchronization. For more information, see [Upsert Custom API Entries](/guides/How-To/commerce-extensions/create-a-multilocation-inventories-resource#upsert-custom-api-entries).

Additionally, we have also added a checkbox in Commerce Manager to enable the upsert functionality. See [Creating Custom APIs](/docs/commerce-manager/commerce-extension/commerce-extension-in-cm#creating-custom-apis).
