**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, a bundle can now consist of one or more products. This is useful if you have a fixed, marketable banner product featuring only one item, such as a 'product of the week'. In this use case, the banner bundle description remains the same, while the product within the bundle can be easily swapped in and out. For more information, see **[Bundles](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles)**.
