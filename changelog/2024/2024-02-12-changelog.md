**INTEGRATION HUB**: Released **Algolia - Full / Delta / Large Catalog** V64 (US) and V49 (EU): The new version includes a fix in the validation process for sale price currencies. Previously, an issue arose where currencies were provided as present but null. This update introduces additional validation steps to rectify the errors resulting from this issue.

**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, when you create variations and variation options, two new attributes, **created\_at** and **updated\_at**, allow you to see when variations and variation options were created or updated. For more information, see **[Variations API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/pxm-product-variations-api/variation-api-overview)** and **[Variation Options API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/pxm-variation-options-api/variation-options-api-overview)**.
