**MINOR** For a subscription with a `pending` state, you can now configure a `go_live_after` date. This is useful as it ensures both the subscription provider and subscriber are clear about when a subscription officially begins. For more information, see [Creating a pending subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions/subscriptions#creating-a-pending-subscription).
