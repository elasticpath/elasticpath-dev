**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, pagination is now supported on the **Get All Jobs** endpoint. In addition, a bug has been fixed where the dates and times in the Jobs API responses were not in the correct format. For more information, see **[Get All Jobs](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/jobs-api/get-all-jobs)**.
