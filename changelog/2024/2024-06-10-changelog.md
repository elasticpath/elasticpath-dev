**MINOR** We have made an enhancement to cart side effect messages on promotion applications. Now, when a second promotion using the same code as an existing one in the cart is applied, the side effects provide more detailed messages, indicating the removal and addition of different promotions.

**INTEGRATIONS HUB**: Released **Algolia - Full / Delta / Large Catalog** V69 (US) - V54 (EU): This new version includes a fix for an intermittent issue with some dropped images during catalog sync. For more information, see **[Integrating with Algolia](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/composer/integration-hub/site-search/algolia)**.
