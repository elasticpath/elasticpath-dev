**MAJOR** We have introduced a new feature, called **Promotions Builder,** powered by our Rule Promotion engine. This feature offers you the flexibility in providing diverse discounts to shoppers, supporting discounts of varying complexities, ranging from code-based customer discounts to Buy X Get Y discounts, fixed price promotions, cart fixed discount, and many more based on your business needs. Moreover, it is compatible with our existing legacy promotions capability, ensuring a smooth transition to the new Promotions Builder. For more information, see **[Promotions Builder in Commerce Manager](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/rule-promotions/promotions-in-commerce-manager/overview)**. To create promotions using API, see **[Rule Promotions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/rule-promotions/overview)**. To apply Rule Promotions API in carts and orders, you must enable the **use\_rule\_promotion** field in **[Cart Settings](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-management/cart-settings/update-cart-settings)**.

**MINOR** The **[Get all Products](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/ep-pxm-products-api/get-all-products)** and **[Get all Promotions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotion-management/get-all-promotions)** endpoints now support beta filtering. The new syntax is an evolution of the original syntax, and allows more characters and formats. For more information, see **[Beta Filtering](https://elasticpath.dev/guides/Getting-Started/filtering#beta-filtering)**.
