**INTEGRATION HUB**: Released **Algolia - Full / Delta / Large Catalog** V63 (US) and V48 (EU): The new version includes bug fixes that address potential occurrences of errors within the category search attributes when a product is assigned to multiple nodes. Additionally, a bug was fixed to ensure that the **ep\_name\_plus\_slug\_categories** option defaults to **false**.

**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, when you import products that have templates, you can now use template slugs as well as IDs to import templates associated with products. This makes it easier to see that data is being imported into the correct template fields. For more information, see **[Importing Custom Data (Flows)](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/product-importer-csv#importing-custom-data-flows)**.
