**MAJOR** Commerce Manager: A new **Nodes** view is now available in **Product Experience Manager** > **Configurations**. The **Nodes** view arranges nodes in a tree-like structure, enabling you to see at a glance the relationships between your nodes and making navigation easier between nodes. You can move nodes by dragging and dropping them between other nodes, enabling easier management of your nodes. For more information, see **[Hierarchies](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/hierarchies/hierarchy/overview)**.
