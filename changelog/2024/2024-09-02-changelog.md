**MAJOR** Subscriptions now supports external payment methods. External payment methods are payment methods not offered by Elastic Path Subscriptions (such as Elastic Path Payments powered by Stripe or Authorize.net), but they can still be integrated with Subscriptions, giving you more flexibility and choice when selecting payment methods. For more information, see [External Payments]().
