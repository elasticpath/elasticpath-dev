For more information, see **[Get all Promotions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotion-management/get-all-promotions#filtering)** and **[Get Promotion Codes](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotion-codes/get-promotion-codes#filtering)**.

Additionally, in Commerce Manager, we have added a new **Search coupon code** field to filter a promotion code within a specific promotion.
