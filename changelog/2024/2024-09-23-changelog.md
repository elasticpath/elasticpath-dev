**MINOR** A `cart.updated` event is now emitted whenever any tax-related operation occurs on the cart, such as adding, updating, deleting, or performing bulk actions on [tax items](/docs/api/carts/tax-items). For more information, see [Observable Events](/docs/api/integrations/integrations-introduction#observable-events).
