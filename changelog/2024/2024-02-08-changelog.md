**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, when you create product prices and modifiers, two new attributes, **created\_at** and **updated\_at**, allow you to see when product prices and modifiers were created or updated. For more information, see **[Price Books API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks-prices/pxm-prices-overview)** and **[Price Book Modifiers API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks-modifiers/pxm-pricemodifiers-overview)**.
