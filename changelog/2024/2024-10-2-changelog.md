**MAJOR** We have introduced a new feature allowing the creation of promotion codes specifically for first time shoppers, who have not yet completed a purchase with the store. Within Commerce Manager, you can now create a single code and select the option to apply it exclusively for first time shoppers. For more information, see [Creating a Single Code](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-promotion-codes).

For details on creating a first time shopper promotion code via the API, see [Create First time Shopper's Coupon Code](/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-first-time-shopper-code).

**MINOR** Commerce Manager: We have added a new feature allowing you to duplicate an existing promotion in Promotions Builder. For more information, see [Duplicating a Promotion](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#duplicating-a-promotion).
