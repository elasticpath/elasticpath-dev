**MAJOR** We have introduced a new feature allowing the creation of promotion codes specifically for first time shoppers, who have not yet completed a purchase. Within Commerce Manager, you can now create a single code and select the option to apply it exclusively for first time shoppers. For more information, see [Creating a Single Code](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-promotion-codes).

For details on creating a first time shopper promotion code via the API, see [Create First time Shopper's Coupon Code](/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-first-time-shopper-code).
