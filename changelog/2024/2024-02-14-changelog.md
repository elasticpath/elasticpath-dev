**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, when you export products that have templates, you can now use template slugs instead of IDs to export templates associated with products. For more information, see **[Product Export API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/exporting-products/export-products#query-parameters)****[.](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/exporting-products/export-products#query-parameters)**

**MINOR** We have now updated our system to calculate line finances based on unrounded unit values, ensuring accuracy and reducing rounding errors during the order calculation process.
