**MINOR** Previously, we had introduced the ability to model data with uniqueness constraints for string fields in Commerce Extensions. This feature is now further enhanced to be case-insensitive, that is, to take different cases into account for conflicts. For more information, see [Custom Fields](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-fields#string-validation).
