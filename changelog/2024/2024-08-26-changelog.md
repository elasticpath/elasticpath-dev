**MAJOR** We have added **Promotions Builder Usages** to help you track and understand how promotional offers are utilized. With this feature, you can: 

- Retrieve the usage history of a specific promotion.
- Track the history of a particular promotion code within a promotion.
- Anonymize customer email addresses associated with promotion usages. 

For more information see [Promotion Usages](/docs/promotions-builder/overview#promotion-usages).
