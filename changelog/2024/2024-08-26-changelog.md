**MAJOR** We have added **Promotions Builder Usages** to help you track and understand how promotional offers are utilized. With this feature, you can: 

- Retrieve the usage history of a specific promotion.
- Track the history of a particular promotion code within a promotion.
- Anonymize customer email addresses associated with promotion usages. 

For more information, see [Promotion Usages](/docs/promotions-builder/overview#promotion-usages).

**MAJOR** We have introduced a new **Exclusion feature** in Promotions Builder within Commerce Manager. This feature allows you to exclude specific products, categories, or attributes from promotions, providing more flexibility in setting up promotion rules. For more information on setting up a new promotion with exclusions, see [Creating a Promotion in Promotions Builder](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder).
