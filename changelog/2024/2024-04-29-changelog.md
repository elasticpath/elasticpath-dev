**MAJOR** We have now introduced a new feature, called Commerce Extensions that supports the creation of Custom APIs according to your business needs. These Custom APIs support a variety of field types, including:

*   String with customizable length limits and regex validation
*   Integer with minimum and maximum value constraints
*   Boolean

Moreover, Commerce Extensions offers the ability to apply filters to all fields, enabling multidimensional data retrieval. Additionally, we've enhanced sorting and filtering capabilities based on creation and last update dates. For more information, see **[Commerce Extensions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/commerce-extensions/overview)**.

You can also create new Custom APIs within Commerce Manager. For more information, see **[Commerce Extensions in Commerce Manager](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/commerce-extensions/commerce-extension-in-cm)**.
