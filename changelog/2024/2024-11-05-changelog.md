**MINOR** We have introduced Flows support for Promotions Builder that allows users to create custom fields for promotions. For example, you can create cusom fields to [display custom promotion terms and conditions](guides/How-To/promotions-builder/use-flows-with-promo-builder.mdx) messaging in the storefront.
