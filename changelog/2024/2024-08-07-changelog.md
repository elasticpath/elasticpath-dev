**MINOR** In Subscriptions, we can now have a subscription status of **Pending**. This is useful as it allows subscriptions to be imported without the risk of the original platform and the Elastic Path Subscriptions platform processing payments for the same billing period. For more information, see [Subscription Imports](/docs/api/subscriptions/imports).
