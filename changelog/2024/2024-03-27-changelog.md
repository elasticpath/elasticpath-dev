**MAJOR** You can now use product tags to store or assign a key word against a product or service that you sell in your store. For example, you could tag the products that you sell by color. This allows your shoppers to search your products by color, enabling them to quickly find what they are looking for, increasing the likelihood of a purchase, and boosting conversion rates.

**MINOR** A new **count** attribute maintains the published release count of catalogs in the catalogs **Release** object. For more information, see **[Catalog Releases](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview#the-release-object)**.
