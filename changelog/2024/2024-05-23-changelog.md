**MINOR** We have introduced support for float field types in Commerce Extensions to support your business needs. For more information, see **[Custom Fields](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-fields)**.

**MINOR** We have added events for Custom API entries. You can integrate Commerce Extensions with your external systems by observing the appropriate events. For more information, see **[Custom API Entries](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-api-entries)**.

**MINOR** Shoppers can now select a bundle that has a default list of products. Shoppers can choose to have all the default products, keep some of the default products or change the default products completely. This is useful, for example, if you want a new addition fragrance in a fragrance bundle to appear as the default option. For more information, see **[Dynamic Bundles](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#dynamic-bundles)**.
