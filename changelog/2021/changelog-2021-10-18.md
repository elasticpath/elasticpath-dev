**Minor** The default [rate limiter](/docs/commerce-cloud/api-overview/rate-limits) for all stores in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud was set to 100 req/sec. However, we now have different rate limiters for different type of stores. The rate limiter for developments stores is 25 req/sec, which is less than the default rate limiter for production stores.
