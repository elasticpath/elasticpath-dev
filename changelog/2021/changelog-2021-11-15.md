**Major** Added the new product bundles feature that supports creating [bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles). For more information, see the [Product Experience Manager (EP PXM) Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles) and [API](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle) sections.

**Minor** Added [bundle sales pricing](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles#sale-pricing), so that users can set sale prices on individual items within the bundle.
