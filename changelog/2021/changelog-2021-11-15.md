**Major** Added the new product bundles feature that supports creating [bundles](/docs/api/pxm/products/products). For more information, see the [Product Experience Manager (EP PXM) Bundles](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#bundles) and [API](/docs/api/pxm/products/products) sections.

**Minor** Added [bundle sales pricing](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#sale-pricing), so that users can set sale prices on individual items within the bundle.
