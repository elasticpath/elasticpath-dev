More common with eCommerce customers Gorgias (pronounced Gorgeous) is a helpdesk solution for storefronts.

**Icons & Images**

We've tweaked the media manager so that you can now select any image or icon for any media component.

Now when you are selecting an icon the media manager will open on the "Icons" tab, but you will also be able to select "
Images" to pick an icon instead.

The same is true for media which defaults to the "Images" tab but allows you to select "Icons".
