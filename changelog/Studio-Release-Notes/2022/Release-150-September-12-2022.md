#### Overview

This release includes several bug fixes, improvements to the help panel, and most excitedly... the option to show/hide
certain sections or elements on mobile! ðŸŽ‰

#### Banner Features

**Mobile Visibility Options!**

With this release we added the ability to control what devices you want to show sections or elements. You can now use
these controls to show a section on all devices, mobile only, or desktop only.

**Need help prompt**

As part of the many ways we're trying to help people get set up on Unstack, we've added an in-app prompt in the editor
that asks the user if they'd like to schedule a time with our Success team.

This prompt is shown to all users on pages that haven't been published (after the first day). After dismissal, it will
be shown periodically until the account has sufficient publish activity (10 clicks on the publish button).

**Help panel polish**

We've updated our help panel with better controls for the video and a smaller layout for smaller viewports.
