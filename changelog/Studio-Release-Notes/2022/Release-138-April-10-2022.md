#### Overview

An exciting release! For our Shopify users we have added support for using Shopify's "liquid" header and footer with the
pages you create in Unstack. At the moment this isn't yet enabled for all stores, but will be in the coming weeks once
we're able to test it with some of our partners.

#### Banner Features

**Shopify header, footer, and cart**

As mentioned above, this feature isn't yet enabled for all stores as it's in need of some additional testing with our
partners before we push it live for everyone.

That said, once it's live you'll be able to use your existing header, footer, ***and*** your cart (including upsell
options!) with the pages you create with Unstack.
