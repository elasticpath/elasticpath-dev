#### Overview

The big news in this release is that we shipped an early version of the mobile editor. We also made some changes to sync
and made it possible to name colors.

#### Banner Features

**Mobile Editor MVP**

With this release we shipped the first version of our new mobile editor. This has been under development for a few weeks
and we wanted to get what we have merged even though it is not ready for prime time. For now, it is accessible to key
customers so that we can continue to gather feedback before releasing this to everyone.

**Better labels for colors**

Previously, adding colors was something you could do, but you weren't able to give them custom labels. Now custom labels
are fully supported.
