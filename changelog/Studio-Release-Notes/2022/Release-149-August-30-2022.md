#### Overview

A solid release with new expanded component development features, several bug fixes, and an easier way for Shopify users
to log in.

#### Banner Features

**Element Properties**

Expanding on the component property work that we've done over the last few months, this release introduces this
functionality to individual elements within components. At the time of this release none of our components are using
this functionality, but stay tuned in the coming weeks as we add some really neat features to our product & media
components. üëÄ

**Removing Unneeded Components**

As part of our quest to make Unstack easier for customers to understand and use we deprecated a large number of media
and text components. These components had features that aren‚Äôt commonly used and only added clutter when people were
looking for the more commonly used components.

These changes reduce the total count of components to 30. That‚Äôs down from 60 in the spring!

Here‚Äôs the list of deprecated components:

1. Media / Text + Features
2. Media / Text + Features (Desktop App)
3. Media / Text + Features (Mobile App)
4. Media / Text + Logos
5. Media / Text + Logos (Desktop App)
6. Media / Text + Logos (Mobile App)
7. Media / Text + Quote
8. Media / Text + Quote (Desktop App)
9. Media / Text + Quote (Mobile App)
10. Media / Text + Isometric
11. Media / Text + Isometric (Desktop App)
12. Media / Text + Isometric (Mobile App)
13. Media / Text + Stacked (Mobile App)
14. Media with stacked callouts
15. Text / 2 Column

In the page editor, these components will now have the ‚ÄúDeprecated‚Äù badge. They will continue to function as before, but
you will no longer be able to add them to new pages.

**Login with Shopify**

We've added a ‚ÄúSign in here‚Äù button for Shopify merchants! Clicking this button will take our merchants to Shopify where
they can sign in and access Unstack.
