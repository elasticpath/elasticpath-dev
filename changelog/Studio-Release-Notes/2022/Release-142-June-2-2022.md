#### Overview

This release is a massive one for us, but the notes on what is included are very, very short. This release was all about
getting something that we've been wanting to release for quite some time - **Media Micro Service (MMS).**

MMS will allow us to improve the ways that Unstack handles images and unlocks a couple paths for us to do some cool
stuff with media going forward. We don't have anything to share on this at the moment, but *promise that we will have
more to come on this at a later date.*

#### Complete List of Resolved Items

* Other than MMS, *no other fixes or adjustments went out with this release*.
