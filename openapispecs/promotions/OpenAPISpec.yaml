  title: Promotions Standard Introduction
  description: |
    Promotions Standard offer the flexibility to provide different types of discounts to all your customers or specific customers. You can apply promotions automatically to all purchases, or alternatively, create promotion codes that customers must enter to receive a discount.
    
    You can have multiple promotions active at the same time. Promotions are active in a fixed duration, with defined start and end dates. However, you can manually stop a promotion at any time.
    
    For testing your promotions when scheduling a future date for your shopping cart, you can use the [Preview Cart API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/carts/cart-management/create-multi-cart#post-create-a-preview-cart).
    
    When [Creating a Free Gift Promotion](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), set the promotion to automatic and enable the auto_add_free_gift feature. This way, the shopper will see the free gift in their shopping cart when the target product is added to the cart, and the discount will be applied. This eliminates the need for an additional step to apply the code for the gift discount. However, if you desire more control over when or how the free gift is added, you can choose to use a promotion code and disable the Automatically add free gift items to the cart toggle in Commerce Manager. See [Creating Free Gift Promotions](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotions-cm/item-level-promotions/free-gift-promotions). For a seamless process, ensure that the currency of automatically added gift items matches with the currency of the the eligible items. Additionally, ensure that the free gift item is within the same catalog as the eligible items. See Errors section.
    
    For inventory-managed products, ensure that you have sufficient inventory available to run the promotion. If there is insufficient stock of free gift items for all eligible free products, the free gifts won't be added to the cart.
    
    Promotions Standard can be:

    - Cart-level promotions: The promotion applies to the entire cart.
    - Item-level promotions: The promotion applies individual items in a cart.
    
    :::note
    
    The shipping prices do not impact eligibility for item-level and cart-level promotions.
    
    :::
    
    All items in the cart are eligible for cart-level promotions, even if they already have item-level promotions applied. You can select a few products and exclude them from a cart-level promotion. However, the store that uses a simple calculation method does not support promotions with the exclude setting.
    
    ### Cart-level Promotions
    
    Cart-level promotions are applied to all items in the cart. Cart-level promotions include:

    - Fixed discount: Reduces the cart total by a fixed amount, such as $5.00 off.
    - Percentage discount: Reduces the cart total e by a specific percentage, such as 10% off.
    
    ### Item-level Promotions

    Item-level promotions are applied to each item that qualifies for the promotion. In a shopping cart, the price of each item reflects the discount applied to each item. With the max_applications_per_cart setting, you can limit the number of purchases of an item at the sale price in a cart. For more information, see the Promotions API section.
    
    Item-level promotions include the following promotion types:
    
    - X for Y: Offers bulk discount based on unit price, such as 2-for-1 sales.
    - X for amount: Offers a bulk discount based on a fixed price, such as 3-for-$20 sales.
    - Bundle: Offers bulk discount when selected products are purchased together. For example, Buy any two items from the list for $100.
    - Item fixed discount: Reduces the price of multiple items by a fixed amount, such as $5.00 off.
    - Percentage item discount: Reduces the product price for multiple items by a specific percentage, such as 10% off. You can also count the number of usages of the promotion per SKU item and limit the usage of the promotion per item. For example, if the usage of the promotion is limited to ten and the shopper purchases two of the same item and three of the another item, five uses of the promotion is deducted from the total usage limit.
    - Free Gift: Offers a free item when a specific product or a group of products are purchased.
    
    You can create codes for a promotion so that customers receive the discount only when the code is provided.
    
    ### Multiple promotions for the same SKU
    
    You can have multiple promotions for the same SKU. However, each instance of the SKU in the cart is eligible for only one item-level promotion.
    
    :::note
    
    The promotions are applied in the order of date of creation of the promotions. The oldest promotion is applied first and the newest promotion is applied last. For each instance of a SKU that matches the criteria in the oldest promotion, the promotion is applied. For the remaining instances of the SKU, each instance is compared to the criteria for the next oldest promotion.
    
    :::
    
    For example, a cart consists of 1 BestEver Coffee Maker and 2 BestEver Coffee Grinders. The following promotions are available and applied automatically without a code:
    
    - An existing BestEver Coffee Maker + Grinder bundle promotion for $200.00. The bundle discount is distributed among the items in the bundle depending on the price of each item.
    - A newly added BestEver Coffee Grinders 10% Off percentage item discount promotion.
    
    In this example, BestEver Coffee Maker costs $150 and BestEver Coffee Grinder costs $100. The promotions works in the following order:
    
    1. The $50 bundle discount is distributed among the items depending on the cost. In this example, the cost proportion of products is 3:2 and the BestEver Coffee Maker gets $30 discount and BestEver Coffee Grinder gets $20 discount.
    2. The second promotion is applied to the remaining BestEver Coffee Grinders item, and the price is reduced to $90.
    3. The cart total after both discounts is $290 instead of $350.
    
    ### Understanding how Promotions work with Bundles
    
    #### Discounting Promotion Bundles
    
    Bundles offer a bulk discount when selected products are purchased together. For example, for a bundle promotion, (SKU1 or SKU2 ) + SKU3, the promotion is applied if the bundle includes either SKU1 and SKU3 or SKU2 and SKU3. This setup encourages the purchase of multiple items together at a discounted rate.
    
    #### Discounting Product Bundles via promotions
    
    For both Cart-level promotions and Item-level promotions, discounts are applied at the bundle level that can have fixed bundle price or automatic/cumulative pricing.
    
    It is important to note that promotions do not apply to components within a bundle even if the individual item within the components qualifies for promotion. See the following examples:
  
      - **Example 1**: Consider that Playtend Games offers a bundle that includes a game console, the Playtend Invaders Game, and the Invaders Controller. If there is an existing Item Percent Discount for the Playtend Invaders Game when sold separately, this discount will not apply when the game is part of the bundle. This ensures that the bundle pricing strategy is maintained.
      - **Example 2**: In the case of Attribute-based promotions, consider a bundle that consists of *Item A* with attribute *Brand A* and *Item B* with attribute *Brand B*. If *Item A* with attribute *Brand A* qualifies for Item Percent Discount promotion, this discount is not applied to the bundle since the *Item A* is a component item within the bundle.
    
    To learn how to create a bundle, see [Create a Bundle](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle).
    
    ### Promotion Codes
    
    You can create codes for a promotion so that customers receive the discount when the code is provided. You can enable this feature by setting the automatic attribute to false in the promotions schema when you create a promotion. For more information, see the Creating Promotion Codes section.
  
    You can generate and export codes for a promotion using the bulk code generation feature, which allows you to create a large number of unique codes and export them in CSV format. For details, refer to the Generating Bulk Codes and Managing Export Codes sections.
  
    You can generate a maximum of 1000 codes for a promotion. If you need to generate more than 1000 codes, limit the promotion's duration to a maximum of 365 days from its start date. The promotion expiry date is 365 days.
  
    With the consume unit feature, you can limit the number of usages of a code for a promotion. You must create a code for this promotion to track the usage of the promotion. The consume unit options are `per_cart` and `per_item`. For example, consider a store that offers 50% off on *SKU1*, but limits the promotion to a maximum of two usages. Under the `per_cart` setting, a shopper can buy *SKU1* twice in a separate transaction, each at a 50% discount. However, with the `per_item` setting, if a shopper buys two SKU1s in a single purchase, both items count toward the promotion's usage limit. Therefore, the shopper would use up both usages of the promotion in a single purchase.
    
    Promotion codes can be group codes or individual codes. For example, you can offer a seasonal discount to all customers, such as SUMMER-SALE, or you can offer preferred customers unique discount codes. Promotion codes expire automatically at the end of the promotion period and are removed from the promotion.
  
    When a promotion expires, the promotion codes attached to the promotion automatically become invalid. However, when you re-enable the expired promotion, the promotion codes attached to the promotion are deleted.
  
    When you checkout a cart with an expired promotion, the expired promotion will be automatically removed from a cart and the checkout process is initiated. As a best practice, we recommend to update your cart to remove the expired promotion before initiating the checkout process.

        ### Filtering
    
        The following operators and attributes are available when filtering on this endpoint. See [Supported Filtering Characters](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/api-overview/filtering#supported-characters).

        Use `code` filter to search codes within promotions.

        | Attribute | Type | Operator     | Example                            |
        |:-----|:---------|:---------|:----------------------------------------|
        | `code` |  `string`   | `eq` | `eq(code,some_code)`          | 
        
        For filtering advanced promotion usages, pass the EP-Public-Search-Type=cm_search header. Advanced search filtering is only applicable when the promotion code is consumed and the promotion is not deleted.
        
        | Attribute | Type | Operator     | Example                            |
        |:-----|:---------|:---------|:----------------------------------------|

    description: |
      With Promotions Standard, you can provide different types of discounts to all your customers or specific customers. A promotion can be set to apply automatically or by entering a code. Automatic promotions are applied when the selected items meet the promotions criteria. Promotions with codes are applied when customers enter the promotion code to get to discount. Commerce offers the following types of promotions.
      
      ### Cart-level Promotions
      
      - **Cart Fixed Discount Promotion**: Adds a fixed amount discount to a cart.
      - **Cart Percent Discount Promotion**: Adds a percentage discount to a cart based on the value of the `cart_items` and `custom_items` objects.
      
      ### Item-level Promotions

      - **X for Y** Discount Promotion: Provides an option to sell more than one item of the same product for a specific price. For example, *2 for 1* or *3 for 2* promotions. If a cart contains more items that are eligible for *2 for 1* promotion, the promotion amount is multiplied by the number of eligible collection.
      - **X for Amount Discount Promotion**: Provides an option to sell a specific number of items of the same product for a fixed amount. For example, buy two items for $10 or four items for $20.
      - **Fixed Bundle Discount Promotions**: Provides a fixed price for a selection of products when you buy the selected products together. For example, buy products *x*, *y*, and *z* for $15 or buy two *x* and three *y* or *z* for $25.
      - **Item Fixed Discount Promotion**: Reduces the product price for multiple items by a fixed amount, such as $5.00 off.
      - **Item Percent Discount Promotion**: Reduces the product price for multiple items by a percentage, such as 10% off.
      - **Free Gift Promotions**: Offers a free item when a specific product or a group of products are purchased.

      :::note
      
      Already existing promotions created before September 28, 2022 will not have `created_by` and `updated_by` attributes in their response body.
      
      :::
      
      :::warning
      
      - Item-level promotions are only supported by the line calculation method. For more information about this method, see the Calculation Method section.
      - The `max_discount_value` setting specifies the maximum possible discount for the cart. To avoid the conflict with the promotions and the promotion to work, we recommend not to use this setting for the following promotions:
          - Item Fixed Discount Promotion
          - Cart Fixed Discount Promotion
          - X for Y Discount Promotion
          - Fixed Bundle Discount Promotions
          - Bundle
          - Free Gift Promotions
      - The maximum application per cart setting, which specifies the maximum number of applications of a promotion per cart, is applicable to line-item promotions only. For example, in a store that offers buy *SKU1* get a free gift promotion with maximum application per cart set to one, the buyer can only use the free gift promotion once per cart. If `max_applications_per_cart` is not set, the buyer can use the promotion multiple times. You can also set `max_applications_per_cart` to zero to remove any usage limit.
      - The `exclude` array consists of `productIDs` or `SKUs` of products to be excluded from the cart-level promotions, such as `fixed_discount` and `percent_discount`. However, the stores that use simple calculation method do not support excluding products from promotions.

      ### The `schema` Object
      
      Promotions are defined by schemas that are used internally to verify promotions and calculate discounts. For each promotion, you must define a schema when you create the promotion. Each promotion type has its own required fields.

  - name: Promotion Codes

      You can apply promotions automatically to all customer carts, or you can create promotion codes that customers must enter to receive the discount. For more information, see the [Create Promotion Codes](#tag/Promotion-Codes/operation/createPromotionCodes) section.
      
      When a promotion expires, the promotion codes attached to the promotion automatically become invalid. However, when you re-enable the expired promotion, the promotion codes attached to the promotion are deleted.
      
      When you checkout a cart with an expired promotion, the expired promotion will be automatically removed from a cart and the checkout process is initiated. As a best practice, we recommend to update your cart to remove the expired promotion before initiating the checkout process.
      
      When extending the end date of an expired promotion with over 1000 codes, you will receive an error response. In such cases, we recommend duplicating the promotion, allowing you to set the new end dates and create promotion codes as needed.
