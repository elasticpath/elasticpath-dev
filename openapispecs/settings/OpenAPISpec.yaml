  title: Settings Introduction
  description: |
    The Settings API allow you to configure global settings for your project. You can define:
    
    - [page length when paginating results](/docs/api/settings/settings-introduction#page-length)
    - [the calculation method you want to use for cart and order totals](/docs/api/settings/settings-introduction#calculation-method)
    - [mandatory address fields](/docs/api/settings/settings-introduction#address-mandatory-fields)
    - [readonly store settings for internal stores](/docs/api/settings/settings-introduction#readonly-settings)
    
    ### Page Length
    
    This defines the number of results per page when paginating results (max: 100).
    
    | Name          | Type      | Default | Max |
    |--------------|-----------|--------- |-----|
    | `page_length` | `integer` | 25       | 100 |
    
    For more information on pagination including a list of which resources support pagination, see [Pagination](/docs/commerce-cloud/api-overview/pagination).
    
    ### Calculation Method
    
    This option defines the method used to calculate cart and order totals. Currently there are two methods: `simple` and `line`.
  
    The `simple` method is our previous method for calculating cart and order totals which focuses on the total value of the cart. This should only be used in the case where Composable Commerce is not used for tax calculations. The `line` method treats each line item individually resulting in more accurate figures after taxes and promotions are applied.
    
    | Name         | Type      | Value |
    |--------------|-----------|-------|
    | `calculation_method` | `string` | `line`   |
    | `calculation_method` | `string` | `simple` |
    
    :::note
    
    - For stores created since February 2020, `line` is the default calculation method. Stores created before February 2020 use `simple` as their calculation method.
    - Line-item discount promotions, such as item percent discount and item fixed discount, are only supported by the line calculation method. For more information, see [Promotions Standard](/docs/api/promotions/promotions-standard-introduction).
    
    :::
    
    ### Address Mandatory Fields
    
    You can create an address to associate with an account in your storefront. This defines the address fields that you can use when creating an address in Commerce Manager. For more information, see [Addresses](/docs/api/addresses/addresses-introduction).
    
    Address fields can be required or optional. You can choose which optional address fields to use in your address, depending on your requirements. To change which fields are mandatory for creating an address, see [Update Settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings). Changing the mandatory fields does not impact the addresses of customers made before the change.
    
    The following table describes the address fields, their type and whether they are required by default.
    
    | Name | Type | Required |
    | :--- | :--- |:---------|
    | `type` |`string` | Default  |
    | `first_name` |`string` | Default  |
    | `last_name` |`string` | Default  |
    | `name` |`string` | Optional |
    | `phone_number` |`string` | Optional |
    | `instructions` |`string` | Optional |
    | `company_name` |`string` | Optional |
    | `line_1` |`string` | Default  |
    | `line_2` |`string` | Optional |
    | `city` |`string` | Optional |
    | `county` |`string` | Default  |
    | `region` |`string` | Optional |
    | `postcode` |`string` | Default  |
    | `country` |`string` | Default  |
    
    ### Readonly Settings
  
    For internal store configurations, read-only settings are used and updating these settings fails without returning any error.
  
    :::note
    
    - Refer to the [Performance](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/guides/Getting-Started/pagination#performance) section in the Pagination documentation, which outlines patterns for retrieving all documents without using a higher page offset limit.
    - To change any predefined configuration, contact [Elastic Path support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us).

      description: |-
        You can modify the cart expiry settings to set it to any number of days up to 365. Any existing carts default to the expiry of 7 days. To update cart settings in Commerce Manager, see [Updating Cart setting](/docs/commerce-manager/settings/general-settings#updating-cart-settings).

        With update cart settings endpoint, you can:

        - Enable or disable custom discounts by setting the `custom_discounts_enabled` field to `true`. This allows you to activate your custom discounts from external services. By default, this setting is determined by the cart settings configured for the store.
        - Enable or disable the use of rule promotions within the cart. You can apply this setting either at the store level using the update cart setting endpoint or individually to a specific cart using the [update a cart](/docs/api/carts/update-a-cart) endpoint.
        
        :::note
        
        - You cannot use both custom discounts and rule promotions at the same time.
        - You must remove all existing discounts in the cart before updating it to use rule promotions.
        
        :::
        
        ### Errors
        
        The following error is received if you enable a cart to use both custom discounts and rule promotions:
        
        ```json
        {
            "status": 422,
            "title": "Cannot use both discounts together",
            "detail": "Only one discount setting can be set to true at a time."
        }
        ```
        
        The following error is received if the cart already has an existing promotion and you update it to use rule promotions:
        
        ```jsom
        {
            "status": 422,
            "title": "Cart contains existing discounts",
            "detail": "Remove all existing discounts in cart before updating cart to use rule promotions."
