There are two ways to refund; through your payment gateway and mark it refunded in Commerce Manager, or directly through Commerce Manager or API.

- **Mark as Refunded**: You can manually mark a transaction as refunded. Before you can mark the order as refunded, you need to handle the actual refund on your side with your payment provider. **Mark as Refunded** is a full refund made to the transaction.
- **Refund** through Composable Commerce: You can process a full or partial refund to a supported payment provider directly from Commerce Manager or API by providing the refund amount. When you start the refund process, the request is directly sent to the payment gateway.

:::caution
If you use manual gateway for partial or full refund, you need to handle the actual refund on your side with your payment provider.
:::

With split payments, you can initiate a refund for a specific transaction. You can only initiate a refund against a transaction if the order status is `complete` and payment status is `paid`, or the order is `cancelled`.

- Ensure that the transaction is already captured and complete to refund a specific transaction. The maximum refund amount is equal to the transaction amount. You can issue the refund to the original payment method of the transaction.
- Each transaction must be refunded independently to fully refund an order with multiple transactions.
- Refund amount cannot exceed the total transaction amount and the order amount.
- You can initiate multiple partial refunds for a single transaction. For example, the total order amount is $100 with two transactions, where the first transaction value is $60 and the second is $40. In this case, you can initiate multiple partial refunds for the first transaction until the total refunded amount is equal to $60. Similarly, you can initiate multiple partial refunds for the second transaction until the total refunded amount is $40.

### Request Example - Mark as Refunded (manual)

When you manually mark as refunded, you do not need to provide any request body.

```bash
curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/orders/:orderId/transactions/:transactionId/refund \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

### Request Example - Full Refund (automatic)

When you want to full refund the payment via payment provider automatically, you need to provide the amount value in request body.

```bash
curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/orders/:orderId/transactions/:transactionId/refund \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

            "data": {
            "amount": <Total of captured amount>,
          }
        }'
```
