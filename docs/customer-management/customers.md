Customers are the people who purchase products from your store. In a business-to-consumer store, a customer is a shopper who buys products for their personal use. In a business-to-business store, a customer is a buyer who purchases products on behalf of their organization.

When a customer is ready to purchase for the first time, the customer creates a profile. At a minimum, the customer provides personal contact information, such as full name, telephone numbers, and addresses. As a store administrator, you can extend the types of information that you want to collect about customers. For example, if the customer is a buyer, you might also collect information about their organization and preferred method of payment.

As a customer uses your store, you can enhance the customer profile with relationships to other information, such as payment methods, promotions, and order history.
