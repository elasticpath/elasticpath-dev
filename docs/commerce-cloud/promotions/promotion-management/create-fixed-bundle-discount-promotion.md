### Body

 | Name | Required | Type | Description |

For more information about creating codes, see the [Create Promotion Codes](/docs/commerce-cloud/promotions/promotion-codes/create-promotion-codes) section.|

 |`min_cart_value`| Optional  |`array`| Specifies an array of currency-value objects, `min_cart_value[].currency` and `min_cart_value[].amount`, that provide the minimum cart value required for the promotion to apply. You can add one or several value specifications in different currencies.|
 |`schema`| Required | [`object`](#the-schema-object)| Specifies the bundle requirements and currencies. In bundle requirements, specify the product SKUs and required quantity of products to apply bundle promotion. |

### The `schema` object

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `schema.requirements.targets` | Required | `array [string]` | Specifies an array of required product SKUs or IDs for the bundle discount promotion. For example, for `requirements: [{quantity: 1, targets: ["a", "b"]}, {quantity: 1, targets: ["c", "d"]}]`, this means the promotion requires one of either SKU `a` or `b` and one of either SKU `c` or `d` in the cart to qualify for the bundle discount. |
| `schema.requirements.quantity` | Required | `integer` | Specifies the quantities of products to be applied for the promotion. |
| `schema.currencies[].amount` | Required | `integer` | Specifies the bundle price amount when cart items are qualified for the promotion. For example, when a shopper buys 1 SKU `a` and 1 sku `c` in the cart, the amount is $100. This means $100 is the total amount for both SKUs in the cart. |
| `schema.currencies[].currency` | Required | `string` | Specifies a three-letter currency code. For example, USD. |
|`schema.target_catalogs`| Optional |`array [string]`| Specifies the unique identifiers of the catalogs to be applied for this promotion. If you do not set this parameter, promotion will be applied to all catalogs. |
