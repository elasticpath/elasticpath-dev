## Introduction to API

The Composable Commerce API follows a microservice architecture that enables you to plug commerce into any part of your application. The API is inspired by the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification, follows predictable [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) URLs, and supports [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). The two-track [Authentication Layer](/docs/authentication) enables destructive and non-destructive actions across projects.

## API Base URLs

Commerce supports multiple geographical regions. For each customer, Commerce accounts and stores are created in a specific region. When you interact with and use the Commerce API, ensure that you use the API end point for the region your store is in. To view the **API base URL** field, go to **System > Application Keys** in **Commerce Manager**.

In the documentation, we use the variable name `<your_elasticpath_api_base_url>` in the sample requests. When making API requests, customers substitute the hostname for the variable.

## Authentication

All requests must include an authentication token in the header. Generate the token by using your API keys.

- To find your API keys, go to **System > Application Keys** section in **Commerce Manager**.
- To use the API to generate a token from your API keys, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication) or [Your first API request](/guides/Getting-Started/your-first-api-request#lesson-1-authenticate) sections.
- To learn more about API keys, see the [Security](/docs/authentication/security#api-authentication-credentials) section.

## Postman

If you are looking to test or develop with the Composable Commerce API, we recommend using the [Elastic Path Postman collection](/guides/Getting-Started/test-with-postman-collection). The collection includes all endpoints.

## Software Development Kits

Elastic Path officially maintains the following Software Development Kits (SDK) for Composable Commerce. Other community-driven SDKs are available within the [Moltin GitHub](https://github.com/moltin) organization.

### JavaScript SDK

If you are beginning a new project, we recommend that you use the JavaScript SDK for Composable Commerce, which is under active maintenance. Within this guide, the supported endpoints include sample **JavaScript SDK** requests. The Composable Commerce Reference Store is implemented using this SDK.

Get the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/elasticpath/js-sdk).

### Composable CLI

The [Composable CLI](/docs/developer-tools/composable-cli/installation) is a command line tool designed to make it easy for you to build Elastic Path-powered frontend experiences. It also enables you to configure various services and integrations provided by Elastic Path.

### Composable Starter

The [Composable Starter](/docs/developer-tools/composable-starter/storefront-starter) is a reference implementation of a storefront built using the Composable CLI. It is a fully functional storefront that you can use as a starting point for your own projects. You can also use it to learn how to build a storefront using Elastic Path products.

### Education resources
