Here, we'll walk through initializing, modifying, publishing and testing a new component.
Be sure that you've [set up your environment](/docs/composer/builder/getting-started/first-custom-component/set-up-environment.mdx) first.

## Initialize your component

The Builder CLI tool, `prism`, has a variety of commands, one of which initializes a new custom component project.
Run `prism components:init hello-builder`. You can give your component a description of "My First Component", and for **Type of Connection** select **Basic Connection**.

```bash title="Initialize a new component"
$ prism components:init hello-prismatic

   create assets/icon.png
   create src/index.ts
   create src/index.test.ts
   create src/client.ts
   create jest.config.js
   create tsconfig.json
   create webpack.config.js
   create src/actions.ts
   create src/triggers.ts

"hello-prismatic" is ready for development.
To install dependencies, run either "npm install" or "yarn install"
To test the component, run "npm run test" or "yarn test"
To build the component, run "npm run build" or "yarn build"
To publish the component, run "prism components:publish"

This will create a new directory called `hello-builder` in your current directory.
Open that directory in your code editor.

## Edit your component

The boilerplate component code that is generated contains custom triggers, data sources, connections, and more.
These are all things that are covered fully in the [Writing Custom Components](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx) article, but we can safely remove them for now.
Open the component directory that you just created in your code editor, and remove all files from the `hello-builder/src/` directory _except_ for `index.ts`.
Then, replace the contents of `index.ts` with this:

```typescript title="index.ts"
import { action, component, input } from "@prismatic-io/spectral";

const myAction = action({
  // This is what the action should look like in the integration designer
  display: {
    label: "Say Hello",
    description: "Take a first and last name, and say hello",
  },
  // This action should have these inputs
  inputs: {
    firstName: input({
      label: "First Name",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      example: "John",
    }),
    lastName: input({
      label: "Last Name",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      example: "Doe",
    }),
  },
  // When run, this action should execute this function
  perform: async (context, params) => {
    const message = `Hello ${params.firstName} ${params.lastName}!`;
    // Promise.resolve because perform functions are async
    return Promise.resolve({ data: message });
  },
});

export default component({
  key: "hello-builder",
  public: false,
  // This is what the component should look like in the integration designer
  display: {
    label: "Hello Builder",
    description: "I'm testing custom components",
    iconPath: "icon.png",
  },
  // The component includes these actions
  actions: { myAction },
});
```

## Build your component

The boilerplate default component code uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile TypeScript code into minified JavaScript.
To invoke webpack, run the build command from your `hello-prismatic` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

That will create a `dist/` directory that contains an `icon.png` file for your component (you can swap that out by replacing `assets/icon.png`), and an `index.js` file - the compiled JavaScript code for your component.
Next, run the publish command from your `hello-prismatic/` directory:

```bash
prism components:publish
```

## Test your component

Log in to Builder and create a new integration.
Add an action and search for "My First Component" and select your component and action.

Fill in the **First Name** and **Last Name** inputs of the action.
Then, click **Run** to run a test of your integration.
Select your **Say Hello** step in the test drawer and verify that your step returned a string that concatenates your first and last name together.

## Next steps

Developers learn best by trying things out in code.
Try to add a middle name input, but only print the middle initial, or add a title input that presents a [dropdown menu](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#dropdown-menu-inputs), so users can select "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Dr.", etc.

Make sure to `npm run build` and `prism components:publish` to publish new component changes to Builder, and within the Builder integration designer, you'll need to click **Component Versions** and bump your component version to the latest version.

Once you're ready, head to the [next tutorial](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/wrapping-an-api-in-a-component.mdx) where we'll cover making API calls from a custom component.
