## Input fields

| Argument  | Type                                                           | Description                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `before`  | [`String`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                       | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `last` to implement backward pagination.          |
| `after`   | [`String`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                       | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `first` to implement forward pagination.          |
| `first`   | [`Int`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                             | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `first` edges after the `after` cursor.  |
| `last`    | [`Int`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                             | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `last` edges before the `before` cursor. |
| `offset`  | [`Int`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                             |                                                                                                  |
| `orderBy` | [`ActivityOrder`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/ActivityOrder.mdx)   | DEPRECATED. Prefer using sort_by instead as it allows ordering by many fields.                   |
| `sortBy`  | [`[ActivityOrder]`](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/ActivityOrder.mdx) | Allows specifying many field and direction pairs to sort results by.                             |
