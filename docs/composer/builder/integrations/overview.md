An **integration** is a series of **steps** that execute one after another in series.
Each step runs an action - a small bit of code designed to perform a specific task.
Actions can be things like **HTTP - GET** to fetch the contents of a webpage from the internet, or **Amazon S3 - Put Object** to save a file to Amazon S3.
You can use a combination of actions from common built-in components to build an integration.

An integration is started when its **trigger** fires.
Triggers can either follow a [schedule](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/integrations-triggers/how-to-use-integration-triggers#scheduled-triggers), or can be invoked via a [webhook URL](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/integrations-triggers/how-to-use-integration-triggers#webhook-triggers).

Integrations should be developed to be **configuration-driven**, so they can be deployed to multiple customers with potentially different configurations.
That is accomplished by leveraging [config variables](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/building-integrations#config-variable-inputs), and have configuring steps to reference those variables.

Many integrations have a single **flow**.
That is, they have a single trigger that fires, and a single set of steps that are executed one after another.
Builder also supports grouping multiple related flows together into a single deployable integration.
For example, if you have a third-party service (Acme ERP) that sends data via a variety of webhooks to your integrations, it probably makes sense to have a single Acme Corp integration that you or your customers deploy that is made up of several logical flows.
Each flow has its own trigger, though they all share config variables.

When an integration is completed, it can be [published](#publishing-an-integration).
You can then enable the integration through the [Integration Hub](/docs/composer/integration-hub/integrations-hub).

We recommend that you follow our [Getting Started](/docs/composer/builder/getting-started/build-first-integration) tutorials to first acquaint yourself with integration development and deployment.

## Creating a new integration

To create a new integration in the web app, click **Integrations** from the left-side menu, and then click the **+ Add Integration** button in the upper-right.

When you create a new integration you have a few options:

- You can create a **blank** integration from scratch.
- You can start from an existing [template](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/overview#integration-templates) that you or someone else created.
- Behind the scenes, integrations are saved as [YAML definitions](#yaml-definition).
  You can load a YAML file from your clipboard or from a file.

![Configure a new integration](/assets/configure-new-integration.png)

You will be prompted to give your integration a **name** and **description**, and can optionally [categorize](#categorizing-integrations) your integration and assign it [labels](#integration-labels).

![Add integration](/assets/new-integration-name.png)

Next, you'll be asked to select a trigger for your integration.
This is what will cause your integration to run, and you can change your trigger at any time.

![Select integration trigger](/assets/new-integration-trigger.png)

For more information, see:
- [Building Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/building-integrations)
- [Testing Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/integrations/testing-integrations)

## Integration templates

Some of your integrations will look similar to one another.
For example, if you are importing opportunities and accounts from a dozen CRM vendors, the steps that fetch data will be unique, but the steps that send data to your app will always look the same.
Rather than developing those common steps over and over, it saves time to create an integration template that you and your team can start from when you build additional similar integrations.

To turn your integration into a template, first [publish](#publishing-an-integration) a version of your integration.
Then, open the **Details** dropdown and select **Available as Template**.

![Create a new template of an integration](/assets/available-as-template.png)

You can choose if the template is just for org users.

## Assigning an icon to an integration

Integrations can be assigned icons, to make them more presentable in the [Integration Hub](/docs/composer/integration-hub/integrations-hub).
To assign an icon to an integration from the integration designer by clicking the icon to the left of your integration's name:

![Add icon to integration](/assets/add-icon.png)

Square PNG images that are at least 400 pixels wide look best as integration icons.

![Assign labels to integration](/assets/labels.png)

## Integration labels

Labels help you keep your integrations organized.
You can assign any number of labels to an integration from within the integration designer by opening the **DETAILS** menu:

You can [search](#listing-and-searching-integrations) for integrations by label.
*Note*: for consistency, labels are always lower-cased.

If you would like to update labels on previously published versions of your integration, open the **VERSION HISTORY** drawer and select a previously published version of your integration.
Add labels from the **DETAILS** menu, and click **Save**.

![Update labels for prior published versions of integration](/assets/label-versions.png)

Labels applied to published integration versions appear in the version dropdown menu on an instance configuration page.

![Versions and labels for instance configuration](/assets/label-versions-instance.png)

## Listing and searching integrations

To view all of the integrations your organization has created, click the **Integrations** link on the left-hand sidebar.

![All integrations for organization](/assets/list-integrations.png)

You can search for specific integrations by name by typing a part of the name in the upper search bar, or you can search by **description**, **[category](#categorizing-integrations)**, **[labels](#integration-labels)** or **marketplace availability** by clicking the **Filter** button to the right of the search bar.

![Filter integrations](/assets/search-integrations.png)

## Categorizing integrations

Integrations can be assigned a "category" for easy sorting and filtering.
For example, you might have a dozen "ERP" integrations, a few "Inventory Management" integrations, etc.
Assigning each integration a category allows your team, as well as your customers in the [Integration Hub](/docs/composer/integration-hub/integrations-hub) to view integrations sorted by category.

You can set a category for an integration by clicking the **DETAILS** dropdown button on the top-left of the integration designer:

![Set category for integration](/assets/edit-name-description.png)

## Publishing an integration

By **publishing** an integration, you mark it ready for deployment.

To publish an integration, first open the **VERSION HISTORY** tab on the left side of the page.
If you have unpublished changes you'll see an **Unpublished Draft** listed among the integration's versions.
Type a note about the changes you made to the integration, and then click **SAVE & PUBLISH** to release a new version of your integration:

![Publish integration](/assets/version-history.png)

Integration versions can be marked **Available** or **Unavailable** by toggling the blue toggles to the right of integration versions. Marking an integration version **Unavailable** prevents that version from being deployed.

## Deploying an integration

Once an integration has been [published](#publishing-an-integration), an instance of the integration can be configured and deployed to a customer.

You can also enable your customers to deploy integrations themselves, using [Integration Hub](/docs/composer/integration-hub/integrations-hub).

## Viewing deployed integrations

To view a deployed integration, in Builder, click the **Markeetplace Configuration** tab.

![List of deployed instances](/assets/list-instances.png)

## Forking an integration

Sometimes you will want to make a copy of an integration and modify the copy.
This is called *forking* an integration.

From the integration designer, click the **Settings**. icon on the bottom left of the page.
Then, click **Fork Integrations**.
Give your forked integration a new name and description and then click **ADD**.

## Deleting an integration

:::caution
Use caution when deleting an integration. Deletion of an integration also deletes all deployed instances of that integration.
:::

From the integration designer, click the **Settings** icon on the bottom left of the page.
Click the **Delete Integration** button on the bottom of the page and confirm by clicking **REMOVE INTEGRATION**.

## Integration attachments

Your team can save and share integration-related documents alongside an integration by clicking on the **Attachments** tab from the integration designer page.

![Add attachments to integration](/assets/attachments.png)

## Internal integration documentation

It's helpful to share documentation, specs and notes about an integration with your team members.
You can add internal (non-customer-facing) notes and documentation to an integration by clicking the **Integration Documentation** button on the right-hand side of the integration designer.
This will open up a drawer on the right-hand side of the designer.

The drawer has two tabs: **Edit** and **Preview**.

In the **Edit** tab you can type [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), including external links, code snippets and externally-hosted images:

![Add internal integration documentation](/assets/documentation-markdown.png)

In the **Preview** tab you can view the rendered markdown:

![Preview internal integration documentation](/assets/documentation-rendered.png)

## YAML definition

Behind the scenes, integrations are represented in YAML.
You can view the YAML that defines your integration's flows, steps, inputs, connections and config variables by clicking **Manage** at the bottom-left of Builder, and selecting **Save/Load**.

![YAML for integration](/assets/yaml-definition.png)

If you are exporting the integration and importing it in a different region (US -> EU, for example), make sure you click a **latest component versions** button, as component versions may not match between regions.

:::note
The YAML present in this drawer corresponds to the integration that is currently being displayed.
You can view the YAML of a previous version of the integration by first opening the **VERSION HISTORY** drawer and selecting an older integration version.

If you want to spot differences between an older version of your integration and the current version, you can compare the YAML definition of the older version with the YAML definition of the current version using your favorite diff tool (VSCode has a great built-in [diff tool](https://vscode.one/diff-vscode/)).

:::

### Exporting an integration

Once you've opened the **Save/Load** drawer in the integration designer, you can click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the integration's YAML definition into your clipboard, so you can paste it into an editor of your choice.
You can also click **Save to file** to download a copy of your integration.

### Importing an integration

If you have a YAML definition of your integration saved in your clipboard, you can click **Load from clipboard** to replace your current integration with the definition that you have copied.
Or, you can save a modified YAML file to your computer, and load the YAML definition by clicking **Load from file** and selecting the file you saved.
