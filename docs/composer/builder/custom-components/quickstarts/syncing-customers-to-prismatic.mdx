title: Sync Customers from Your App
description: Learn to sync customers from an external system to Composer using our GraphQL API
---

When you embed Composer into your app, you need to [authenticate](/docs/composer/builder/installing-embedded.mdx#authenticating-users) your customer users as users of a specific customer in Composer.
That's done by specifying a customer's **External ID** when you generate a signed JWT for your customer user.
Those customers need to exist in Composer prior to generating a signed JWT (though you can programmatically check for the existance of a customer and create one when you generate the JWT in your backend).

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to sync customers from your app to Composer using Composer's [GraphQL API](/docs/composer/builder/api/api-overview.mdx).
We'll highlight **External IDs**, which are a way to assign a unique external identifier to a customer.

## Setting up

We'll use Python in this tutorial, though the same ideas can be adapted to any language that has a [GraphQL client library](https://graphql.org/code/).
Full code shown in this tutorial can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/blob/main/api/customers/customers.py).

To start, we'll add `gql` to our dependencies for our Python project:

```bash
pip install gql
```

Next, we'll import our necessary libraries and create a GraphQL client so we can run queries against Composer's API.
We'll define the transport layer for getting to our API (HTTP), which will include an authorization header to authenticate our client against Composer:

```python
import json
import os
import sys
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

token = os.environ['PRISMATIC_API_KEY']
api_endpoint = "https://app.prismatic.io/api/"

transport = RequestsHTTPTransport(
  url=api_endpoint,
  headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
)
client = Client(transport=transport)
```

This code assumes that an environment variable, `PRISMATIC_API_KEY`, has been set (it's best practice not to hard-code API keys).
To get an API key into our environment variables, we can leverage the `me:token` [prism subcommand](/docs/composer/builder/cli/prism.mdx#metoken):

```bash
export PRISMATIC_API_KEY=$(prism me:token)
```

Now that we have a working client, let's write some GraphQL queries and mutations to manage customers within Composer:

## GraphQL queries and mutations

To sync customers, we'll use the [customers](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/query/customers.mdx) query and [createCustomer](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/createCustomer.mdx) and [deleteCustomer](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/deleteCustomer.mdx) mutations.

:::info GraphQL Queries and Mutations
In GraphQL lingo, a **query** is similar to a `SELECT` statement in SQL.
You query for a particular set of information in a read-only way.

A **mutation** is similar to an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement in SQL.
You mutate data by creating new records, or updating or deleting existing records.
:::

## List all customers

First, let's write a function that gets a list of all of our customers, including their `name`, `description`, Composer `id`, and `externalId`:

```python
def getCustomers():
  query = gql("""
    query {
      customers (isSystem: false) {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          description
          externalId
        }
      }
    }
  """)
  result = client.execute(query)
  return result['customers']['nodes']
```

This function runs a [customers](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/query/customers.mdx) query against Composer's API.
We specify `isSystem: false` because your Composer tenant has a set of "system" customers that are used behind-the-scenes for running test integrations as you build them.
This will filter out those "system" customers, and return only your "real" customers.

The query returns an object with a `customers` key, which has (in GraphQL lingo) has a series of **nodes** (customers).
We return `result['customers']['nodes']` so that just a list of customer objects are returned.

Let's invoke this function, and use `json.dumps()` for readability:

```python
print(/docs/composer/builder/json.dumps(getCustomers()))
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "Q3VzdG9tZXI6MThjZTBjM2EtYmQ5NS00MWJiLWIyMjUtN2MwYjVjMDg3YmE4",
    "name": "Mars Missions",
    "description": "Mars Missions Corp",
    "externalId": "abc-123"
  },
  {
    "id": "Q3VzdG9tZXI6MDllZDQyNTctMTNkMS00YTY4LWFiNTktY2Y5NzNmZGUyOTQy",
    "name": "Eastern Space Flight",
    "description": "Eastern Space Flight - Houston, TX",
    "externalId": "xyz-456"
  }
]
```

We could use the output of this function to figure out which customers have not been synced _into_ Composer, or to sync Composer customers back to an outside system.

### GraphQL pagination

Before moving on, I want to address pagination.
By default, the Composer API returns the first 100 results for a query.
So, the [customers](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/query/customers.mdx) query only returns 100 customers, even if we have more than 100 in the system.

If we want to download **all** customers, we'll need to update our `getCustomers()` function a bit.
We'll update our query so that it requests pagination information (`pageInfo`).
We'll request whether or not there are additional pages to fetch (`hasNextPage`), and a unique ID indicating where to start the next page (`endCursor`).
We'll feed that `endCursor` back in to our query as a parameter `after`, so the GraphQL API knows where it last left off:

```python
def getCustomers():
  query = gql("""
    query ($startCursor: String){
      customers(after: $startCursor, isSystem: false) {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          description
          externalId
        }
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
      }
    }
  """)

  cursor = ""
  hasNextPage = True
  customers = [] # Used to accumulate customer objects

  while hasNextPage:
    result = client.execute(query, variable_values={"startCursor": cursor})
    customers += result['customers']['nodes']
    hasNextPage = result['customers']['pageInfo']['hasNextPage']
    cursor = result['customers']['pageInfo']['endCursor']

  return customers
```

## Fetch a specific customer by external ID

Now, let's look at how to look up a specific customer by their `externalId`.
The [customers](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/query/customers.mdx) query allows you to filter customers by `externalId`.
We will pass in the `externalId` as a variable to the customers query using an object, `params`, that contains the GraphQL variables we want to use.
We'll also assert that we got exactly one customer object back from the API:

```python
def getCustomerByExternalId(externalId):
  query = gql("""
    query ($externalId: String!) {
      customers (externalId: $externalId) {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          description
          externalId
        }
      }
    }
  """)
  params = {"externalId": externalId}
  response = client.execute(query, variable_values=params)
  assert len(response["customers"]["nodes"]) == 1, f"No customer with external ID '{externalId}' exists."
  return response["customers"]["nodes"][0]
```

If we invoke this function now, we'll get a single customer based on the `externalId` that we provide:

```python
print(/docs/composer/builder/json.dumps(getCustomerByExternalId("abc-123")))
```

```json
{
  "id": "Q3VzdG9tZXI6MThjZTBjM2EtYmQ5NS00MWJiLWIyMjUtN2MwYjVjMDg3YmE4",
  "name": "Mars Missions",
  "description": "Mars Missions Corp",
  "externalId": "abc-123"
}
```

## Create a new customer

Next, we'll write a function that creates a new customer given the customer's `name`, `description`, and `externalId`.
To do that, we'll use the the [createCustomer](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/createCustomer.mdx) GraphQL mutation.
Similar to the [getCustomerByExternalId](#fetch-a-specific-customer-by-external-id) function above, we'll supply some input variables to our mutation with a `params` object:

```python
def createCustomer(name, description="", externalId=""):
  mutation = gql("""
    mutation($name: String!, $description: String, $externalId: String) {
      createCustomer(
        input: { name: $name, description: $description, externalId: $externalId }
      ) {
        customer {
          id
          name
          description
          externalId
        }
        errors {
          messages
        }
      }
    }
  """)

  params = {
    "name": name,
    "description": description,
    "externalId": externalId
  }

  result = client.execute(mutation, variable_values=params)

  if ("errors" in result):
    raise Exception(result.errors)
  else:
    return result["createCustomer"]["customer"]
```

The `createCustomer` mutation will return `errors` if the `name` or `externalId` you specified is already in the Composer system.
If the mutation does not throw an error, it will return a customer object containing the new customer's `name`, `description`, `externalId` and generated Composer `id`.
Let's try it out:

```python
print(
  json.dumps(
    createCustomer(
      name="Rockets Rockets Rockets",
      description="Rockets^3",
      externalId="456-xyz"
)))
```

```json
{
  "id": "Q3VzdG9tZXI6NGQ3ZDc3ZTktOTllNy00NmJiLWFlNDktMTg1N2JlNWNiYjUz",
  "name": "Rockets Rockets Rockets",
  "description": "Rockets^3",
  "externalId": "456-xyz"
}
```

## Delete a customer by External ID

For the last customer-related function, let's delete a customer given their external ID.
To do that, we'll use the [deleteCustomer](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/deleteCustomer.mdx) mutation.
First, we'll look up the customer we would like to delete using the [getCustomerByExternalId](#fetch-a-specific-customer-by-external-id) function we wrote previously.
Then, we'll feed the Composer ID that we get into the `deleteCustomer` mutation:

```python
def deleteCustomer(externalId):
  customer = getCustomerByExternalId(externalId)
  mutation = gql("""
    mutation ($id: ID!) {
      deleteCustomer(
        input: {
          id: $id
        }
      ) {
        customer {
          id
          name
          description
          externalId
        }
        errors {
          messages
        }
      }
    }
  """)

  params = {"id": customer["id"]}

  result = client.execute(mutation, variable_values=params)

  if ("errors" in result):
    raise Exception(result.errors)
  else:
    return result["deleteCustomer"]["customer"]
```

If we supply an external ID that is not attached to a customer, the `getCustomerByExternalId()` function will throw an error indicating that.
