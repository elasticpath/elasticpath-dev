If you know the value of a config variable - maybe your customer's API key to your app or some other configuration value - you can [set it programmatically](/docs/composer/builder/embedding-marketplace.mdx#dynamically-setting-config-variables-in-marketplace) on behalf of your customer so they don't have to.
