You can integrate Commerce with Amazon Cognito, This allows you to offer your customers or business users Single Sign-on (SSO) using Amazon Cognito credentials instead of Commerce credentials. When you create an Amazon Cognito integration, an Amazon Cognito user pool is created. Your customers can then sign-in directly using the user pool.

| **AWS Cognito User Pool Request**  | `code` |  The API request to create a user pool. See [CreateUserPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUserPool.html). |

### Create User Pool Domain

| **AWS Region** | `string` | AWS provides services in multiple regions, like `us-west-2` or `eu-east-1`. AWS region indicates the region in which your buckets are stored. |
| **AWS Cognito User Pool Request**  | `code` |  The API request to create a user pool. See [CreateUserPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUserPool.html). |
| **Domain Name**  | `string` |  The domain name you want to use for your user pool. It must be unique. We recommend that your domain name is alphanumeric and you only use the `-` special character. The domain is in the format of https://*<domain_prefix>*.auth.<*region*>.amazoncognito.com. For example, if your domain name is `elasticpath-commerce-cloud` and your AWS region is `us-east-1` then your login URL is `elastic-path-commerce-cloud.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com`. The Amazon Cognito Integration creates a subdomain within an Amazon Cognito domain. If you want to use your business domain, then you must configure this directly in Amazon Cognito. | `elastic-path-commerce-cloud.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com` |
| **Custom Domain Certificate ARN**  | `string` | The SSL certificate for your custom domain. You can use Amazon Cognito to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. |
