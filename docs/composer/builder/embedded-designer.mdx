In addition to using productized integrations from your marketplace, some of your customers may need to build unique integrations between your product and the other apps they use. These are often one-off, custom integrations that a single customer needs, but that wouldn't be of value to others.

Embedded designer allows customers to log in to your product and build these integrations using the same integration designer your teams use. And along with the designer, you can give your customers access to private components and templates they can use as starting points for these custom integrations.

This article covers how to embed the integration designer in your product so that your customers can have the best integration building UX.

For information on how to install the embedded SDK and authenticate customer users, see [Installing Embedded SDK](/docs/composer/builder/installing-embedded.mdx).
Note: you should include `"role": "admin"` in JWTs that you sign for customer users who build integrations.

:::info Embedded Designer is an add-on feature
Embedded designer can be enabled for enterprise accounts as an add-on feature. Please contact [support](https://support.prismatic.io) to discuss embedded designer.

## Enabling embedded designer for a customer

Embedded designer is disabled for all customers by default.
To enable embedded designer for a customer, open the customer from the **Customers** screen and then select the **Details** tab.
Toggle the **Allow Embedded Designer** option.

## Embedded screen configuration

Most embedded screens that show components, integrations, instances, etc., take three properties:

- `usePopover` is a boolean that determines if the screen should display as a popover.
  By default, the screen is injected as an iframe into an existing DOM element.
- `selector` identifies which element in the DOM to inject the iframe into when `usePopover` is false.
- `theme` can override [custom theming](#theming-embedded-marketplace) default behavior, and can be set to `"LIGHT"` or `"DARK"` mode.

## Showing component screens

You can embed the component screens in your app using the `prismatic.showComponents` and `prismatic.showComponent` functions respectively.
To show all components that are available in your tenant, use the `showComponents()` function:

```ts title="Showing all components - ReactJS example"
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "my-embedded-builder-div";

function ComponentListView() {
  useEffect(() => {
    prismatic.showComponents({
      selector: `#${id}`,
    });
  }, []);

  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default ComponentListView;
```

To show details about a specific component, use the `showComponent()` function and provide the function with the ID of a component.
You will need to query for the ID of the component using `prismatic.graphqlRequest` function, which you can use to query the Builder API:

```ts title="Showing a specific component"
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "my-embedded-builder-div";

const getComponentId = async (key: string) => {
  const query = `query getComponentByKey($componentKey: String!) {
  components(key: $componentKey) {
    nodes {
      id
    }
  }
}`;
  const result = await prismatic.graphqlRequest({
    query,
    variables: { componentKey: key },
  });
  return result.data.components.nodes[0].id;
};

function DropboxComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const showDropbox = async () => {
      const componentId = await getComponentId("dropbox");
      prismatic.showComponent({
        componentId,
        selector: `#${id}`,
      });
    };
    showDropbox();
  }, []);

  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default DropboxComponent;
```

Additional documentation on querying the Builder API as a customer user from the embedded SDK is available on the [Embedded API Requests](/docs/composer/builder/embedded-api-requests.mdx) article.

For an example of embedding the integration designer, including a check if the current user has integration designer permissions, see [GitHub](https://github.com/prismatic-io/embedded/blob/main/example-embedded-app/pages/examples/embedded-designer.tsx).

## Showing integrations

The `prismatic.showIntegrations` function shows the customer user all of the integrations that are owned by their customer.
Customers can create their own integrations, or integrations can be assigned to them.

```ts
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "integration-list-div";

function IntegrationList() {
  useEffect(() => {
    prismatic.showIntegrations({ selector: `#${id}` });
  }, []);

  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default IntegrationList;
```

From the `showIntegrations` screen, customer users will be able to open existing integrations or create new integrations by clicking the **+Add integration** button (like an organization team member would do).

:::note integrations are scoped to the customer
Integrations are scoped to a customer.
If a customer creates a new integration, or if you assign an integration to a customer, only customer users for that customer see that integration.
:::

### Assigning an integration to a customer

You can build an integration and assign ownership of it to a customer.
To do that, open the integration, select the **Details** tab on the top of the screen, and select the customer who should own the integration from the **Customer** dropdown menu.

## Opening the integration designer directly

If you know the ID of an integration that you would like to open, you can open an integration directly using `prismatic.showDesigner`.
You will need to query for the ID of the component using `prismatic.graphqlRequest` function, which you can use to query the Builder API:

```ts title="Open an integration designer directly"
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "my-embedded-builder-div";

/**
 * Get an integration's ID given its name
 */
async function getIntegrationId(integrationName: string) {
  const query = `query getMyIntegration($integrationName: String!) {
  integrations(name: $integrationName) {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}`;
  const variables = { integrationName };
  const result = await prismatic.graphqlRequest({ query, variables });
  return result.data.integrations.nodes?.[0].id;
}

function EmbeddedDesigner() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const showDesigner = async () => {
      const integrationId = await getIntegrationId("Acme Inc");
      prismatic.showDesigner({
        selector: `#${id}`,
        integrationId,
        theme: "LIGHT",
      });
    };
    showDesigner();
  }, []);
  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default EmbeddedDesigner;
```

## Filtering components in the embedded designer

If you would like to limit the components that a customer user can use in the embedded designer, you can do so by specifying a `filters.components.filterQuery` object when you call `prismatic.showIntegrations` or `prismatic.showDesigner`.
You can filter using a component's `key`, whether or not it's a `public` component, and component `category`.

In this example, we list a few file-related components, as well as a private version of the Slack component and all components in the "Logic" category (like Branch, Loop, etc):

```ts title="Filter components in the embedded designer"
import prismatic, {
  BooleanOperator,
  TermOperator,
} from "@prismatic-io/embedded";

prismatic.showIntegrations({
  selector: `#my-integrations-div`,
  filters: {
    components: {
      filterQuery: [
        BooleanOperator.or,
        [TermOperator.equal, "key", "aws-s3"],
        [TermOperator.equal, "key", "dropbox"],
        [TermOperator.equal, "key", "google-drive"],
        [
          BooleanOperator.and,
          [TermOperator.equal, "key", "slack"],
          [TermOperator.equal, "public", false],
        ],
        [TermOperator.equal, "category", "Logic"],
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

<Screenshot
  filename="embedded-designer/filter-components.png"
  alt="Filter component list in the embedded designer"
  maxWidth="800px"
/>

## Showing logs

The `prismatic.showLogs` function presents a customer user with the logs listview page.
This gives them the chance to view logs from all of their instances in one place.
It is the same view that you would see as an organization team member if you opened a [customer's logs tab](/docs/composer/builder/customers.mdx/#accessing-customer-logs).

```ts
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "logs-div";

function InstanceLogs() {
  useEffect(() => {
    prismatic.showLogs({ selector: `#${id}` });
  }, []);

  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default InstanceLogs;
```

## Showing the customer dashboard

To give your customer a holistic view of their integrations, instances, etc, you can show them the customer dashboard.

```ts
import prismatic from "@prismatic-io/embedded";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const id = "dashboard-div";

function Dashboard() {
  useEffect(() => {
    prismatic.showDashboard({ selector: `#${id}` });
  }, []);

  return <div id={id}>Loading...</div>;
}

export default Dashboard;
```

<Screenshot
  filename="embedded-designer/show-dashboard.png"
  alt="Open the customer dashboard in embedded"
  maxWidth="800px"
/>

### Hiding tabs in the embedded customer dashboard

By default, all tabs are shown to customers when `showDashboard()` is invoked.
To hide certain tabs, include `screenConfiguration.dashboard.hideTabs` parameter when you call `showDashboard()`:

```ts
prismatic.showDashboard({
  selector: `#${id}`,
  theme: "LIGHT",
  screenConfiguration: {
    dashboard: {
      hideTabs: ["Attachments"], // Hide the Attachments tab
    },
  },
});
```

## Customer users and custom components

Your customers can build their own custom components and use them in their integrations.
These private components are scoped to the customer, and are not visible to other customers.
This is helpful if your customer needs to build a custom component that is specific to their business (for example, to wrap their own API).

The building of customer-scoped custom components is done in the same way as it is for organization-wide custom components.
For information on building custom components, see the [Building Custom Components](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx) article or the custom component [getting started guide](/docs/composer/builder/getting-started/first-custom-component/set-up-environment.mdx).

:::info Customer users must be able to log in to Builder
In order for a customer user to publish a custom component, you must [create a customer user account](/docs/composer/builder/users.mdx/#customer-users) and assign them the "Admin" role.
The customer user needs to be able to log in to Builder in order to authenticate the Prism CLI tool to publish custom components.
A customer user cannot use a signed JWT to publish custom components.
:::

Once a customer user has logged in to Builder, they can authenticate the Prism CLI tool by running `prism login` and then publish a component scoped to their customer with `prism components:publish`, as an organization team member would do.

If you would like to publish a component as an organization team member for a specific customer, you can run `prism components:publish --customer <CUSTOMER ID>` using an ID that you can fetch by running `prism customers:list --columns id,name`.
