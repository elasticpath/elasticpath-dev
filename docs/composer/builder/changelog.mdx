### Code-Native Integrations - Reference components

You can now reference triggers, connections, and data sources of existing components when building code-native integrations. Both public and private components can be used in your code-native integrations. By leveraging an existing component, you can save time and effort by reusing existing functionality.

To reference existing components you will need to upgrade to Prism 6.0.0 and Spectral 8.1.0. Prism 6.0.0 requires Node 18 or higher. For those of you that have already started building code-native integrations, note that type definitions now use strings rather than enums to minimize the number of imports required.

Check out the [code-native documentation](/docs/composer/builder/code-native-integrations.mdx) and the video below to learn more.

### Code-Native Integrations

We've introduced a new option for building integrations called code-native! This is the perfect building experience for integration builders who prefer to write code rather than use a low-code designer.

Code-native highlights:

- Build integrations completely within your IDE rather than the low-code designer.
- Triggers, connections, integration logic, and the customer-facing configuration experience are all defined in code.
- Define integration logic however you see fit rather than leveraging predefined logic steps.
- More easily incorporate integrations into your existing CI/CD process and code repositories.

Check out [this blog post](https://prismatic.io/blog/introducing-code-native-integrations/) as well as the video below for more information about the benefits of code-native integrations. Our [code-native documentation](/docs/composer/builder/code-native-integrations.mdx) is an excellent place to start when you're ready to start building your first code-native integration.

### New Integration Designer UX

We've built a new integration designer experience!
Many of our customers have already switched to the new designer, and we're hearing great things.

The new designer makes it faster and easier to build integrations in our low-code environment. Here are the highlights:

1. Streamlined designer canvas that makes better use of space
1. Panning and zooming so you can move around quickly
1. A more intuitive experience for adding and configuring integration steps
1. ...and more enhancements coming soon!

<Vimeo video="894294812" title="New Designer UX" />

To try out the new experience, just toggle the Designer Beta setting you'll see at the top of your integration designer screen.
(Note that any of your customers using the embedded designer won't see the beta version at this time.)

We love it, and we hope you will too!

### New Trigger Events

Custom triggers can now handle the following events:

- `onInstanceDeploy` - when an instance is deployed, all triggers with an `onInstanceDeploy` function will execute that function.
  These functions are handy for setting up webhooks in third-party apps, or for updating your own API to let your team know that a customer has deployed an instance.
- `onInstanceDelete` - when an instance is deleted, all triggers with an `onInstanceDelete` function will execute that function.
  These functions are handy for cleaning up configuration in third-party apps, or for updating your own API to let your team know that a customer has deleted an instance.

### Embedded Designer

Your customers may want to build integrations for themselves between your product and the other apps and services they use.
Embedded designer allows your customers to log in to your app and build integrations using Builder's integration designer.
You can provision your customers access to private components that you have built, and can provide your customers with "templates" that they can use as a starting point for building their own integrations.

<Vimeo video="852820250" title="Embedded Designer Announcement" />

Read more about the embedded designer on [Embedding Integration Designer](/docs/composer/builder/embedded-designer.mdx) docs page.

If you're interested in using embedded designer, please [contact support](mailto:support@prismatic.io) to discuss enabling embedded designer for your organization.

### New Embedded SDK

Along with embedded designer comes a new embedded SDK.
If you are currently using [@prismatic-io/marketplace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/marketplace) for embedded marketplace, swap it out for the new [@prismatic-io/embedded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/embedded) NodeJS package to begin using the embedded designer features.
`@prismatic-io/marketplace` will continue to work, but `@prismatic-io/embedded` is a superset of features and new features and enhancements will only be added to the new embedded SDK.

### Embedded SDK v2.0.0

The newest version of the embedded SDK changes the Marketplace default of `screenConfiguration.marketplace.configuration` to `allow-details` instead of `always-show-details`.
See [docs](/docs/composer/builder/embedding-marketplace.mdx#integration-configuration-detail-screen) for information on the integration configuration detail screen options.

### Linking Execution Replays

[Replays](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx#execution-replay) of executions are now linked to the original execution.
This makes it easier to query for failed executions, and replay only those executions that don't have a subsequent replay that succeeded.

<Vimeo video="848852783" title="Linking Execution Replays" />

See [docs](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx/#instance-execution-retry-and-replay) for more information, and the [Examples repo](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/tree/main/api/replay-failed-executions) in GitHub for the script mentioned in the above video.

```ts
[
  BooleanOperator.or,
  [
    BooleanOperator.and,
    [TermOperator.equal, "category", "ERP"],
    [TermOperator.in, "labels", "paid"],

### User Level Configuration

We're proud to introduce a new instance configuration option - **User-Level Configuration** (ULC).

**What is ULC**?
ULC helps when multiple users of a single customer all need an integration.
It allows you to configure a single instance of an integration for a customer, but collect configuration from multiple users and execute using user-specific configuration.

**Why use ULC**?
ULC is handy if your integration requires user-specific config variables and credentials.
For example, suppose your app needs to write data to several users' private Dropbox folders.
With ULC, you can collect connection information for several users within a customer, and integrate with each of their individual Dropbox accounts.

**How does ULC work**?
At a high level, a single instance of an integration is deployed to a customer, and is configured with some customer-wide config variables.
Individual users within the customer, then, go through a ULC config wizard and supply user-specific credentials and config variables.
When the instance runs, it pulls in user-specific configuration depending on some rules you set.

Read more about ULC in our [docs](/docs/composer/builder/user-level-configuration.mdx).

### Persisting Data for Integrations

You can now persist data between instances of the same integration.
This is handy if your customers need to share some state, or if you need to persist a customer mapping for [preprocess flows](/docs/composer/builder/endpoint-configuration.mdx).

See the [Persist Data](/docs/composer/builder/builder-components/persist-data.mdx) docs, or write your own component that [persists integration data](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#execution-instance-and-cross-flow-state)

### Source Code for Prism and Marketplace

Source code for the `@prismatic-io/prism` CLI tool and the embedded marketplace library, `@prismatic-io/marketplace`, have been added to public repositories on GitHub.

`prism` wraps the [Builder API](/docs/composer/builder/api/api-overview.mdx) and provides users a way to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a variety of Builder resources (components, integrations, instances, customers, etc.) from the command line.
Having it publicly available provides a great reference for developers looking to wrap the Builder API themselves.

The two projects join the custom component SDK, `@prismatic-io/spectral`, which was already publicly available:

- `@prismatic-io/prism` - [https://github.com/prismatic-io/prism](https://github.com/prismatic-io/prism)
- `@prismatic-io/marketplace` - [https://github.com/prismatic-io/marketplace](https://github.com/prismatic-io/marketplace)

### Improvements to Custom Component Development

We've made several improvements to the custom component development experience. To highlight a few:

- You can now [`clean`](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#cleaning-inputs) your reusable inputs, which helps ensure type safety and catches problems with inputs before they reach the `perform` function.
- You can now add a [global error handler](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#global-error-handlers) to your component, which helps you capture and display more informative errors if they're thrown.
- The improved [testing harness](/docs/composer/builder/spectral/spectral-6-upgrade-guide.mdx#new-spectral-testing-harness) gives you more flexibility when unit testing your actions and triggers.
- The `prism` CLI tool can now fetch existing integration connections (including OAuth 2.0 access tokens) and store them in environment variables, so you can [use them for unit testing](/docs/composer/builder/cli/prism.mdx#componentsdevrun).

Update to the latest [`@prismatic-io/spectral`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/spectral) 6.x version to take advantage of these new features!

### Step-Level Error Handling

Sometimes a step in an integration throws an error.
This can be caused by a variety of external factors - temporary network connectivity issues, brief third-party API outages, etc.

You can now configure how the integration runner handles errors on each step.
You can choose to stop the instance execution (that's the current default behavior), you can ignore the error and continue the run, or you can choose to wait and retry the step at a later time.

### Sending Data Through URL Path

Some popular SaaS applications append URL paths to the webhooks that they're configured to use.
So, given a webhook endpoint `https://hooks.us-east-2.elasticpathintegrations.com/trigger/EXAMPLE==` they might send data to `https://hooks.us-east-2.elasticpathintegrations.com/trigger/EXAMPLE==/order/created`.

### Simpler, More Flexible Authentication

We've revamped the way that components connect to third-party apps and services.
The new concept is called **connections**, and they make authentication _simpler_, more _flexible_, and _easier to support_.

We'll be updating our built-in components to use connections in the coming weeks, and credentials will eventually be phased out in favor of connections (but don't worry - credentials won't be sunset immediately!).

For a full run-down how connections improve integration development and support and customer self-deployment, check out our <InternalLink href="/blog/simpler-more-flexible-authentication/">blog announcement.</InternalLink>
Here's a quick summary:

- Component developers have _more flexibility_ when declaring what information their components need to connect to a third party.
  They can define [custom connections](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#adding-connections) that include any number of fields, like username, password, API key, tenant ID, endpoint URL or other fields that are unique to the service they're integrating with.
- The [OAuth 2.0 flow](/docs/composer/builder/configuration-wizard.mdx#oauth-20-connection-config-variables) got much _simpler_ and cleaner for both integration builders and customers who deploy the integration - customers just see a single button to click when they need to authenticate with OAuth.
- Authorization got _simpler_ in general - connections live within the integration designer or a deployed instance.
  You don't need to create credentials from the organization or customer settings pages, nor juggle credential types.
  Components know what connections they're compatible with, and can only be paired with those connection config variables.
- Connections are _easier to support_.
  You can now configure alert monitors to [notify you](/docs/composer/builder/monitoring-and-alerting.mdx#alerting-on-connection-errors) when connections (OAuth or otherwise) expire or fail to authenticate in an integration.

### Write Your Own Triggers

The vast majority of integrations are triggered in one of two ways: they either run on a schedule (i.e "At 15 minutes past each hour") or they're invoked by an HTTP request to a [webhook](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-triggers).

Not all apps and services that you integrate with are the same, though, and some require additional functionality or validation.
For example, Salesforce [outbound messages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_om_outboundmessaging_understanding.htm) (webhooks) require a special XML-formatted acknowledgement (ACK) response to a webhook request, and Amazon's Simple Notification Service (SNS) requires that integrations send an HTTP POST request to AWS to [confirm an SNS subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.prepare.html).

With those considerations in mind, we've extended our [custom component SDK](/docs/composer/builder/spectral/custom-component-library.mdx) to allow you to write your own triggers for your components.
Your triggers can handle things like:

- Replying to webhook requests with custom responses
- Validating webhook headers and payload data
- Transforming and processing XML, CSV, or proprietary data formats so the rest of your integration can easily reference data that comes in

If you've [written your own actions](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#writing-actions), writing a trigger will feel very familiar.
Check out our docs on [writing triggers](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#writing-triggers) to get started, or take a look at our [quickstart](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/writing-a-trigger.mdx) that details how we wrote the Salesforce trigger.

### Configurable Webhook Triggers

The general webhook trigger is now more configurable.
You can now specify the HTTP code, headers, response type, and response body that the webhook trigger returns to a webhook caller.
This helps you handle APIs that require custom responses, and allows you to redirect webhook callers as needed.

### Improved Embedded Marketplace Experience

We've significantly enhanced Builder's embedded marketplace experience, enabling you to provide your customers a seamless, native integration experience with minimal engineering effort.

You can now embed Builder's [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx) into your application with just a few lines of code. You can choose to display the sleek marketplace UX directly within your application or as a popover, and apply [custom theming](/docs/composer/builder/organization.mdx#custom-themes) to make your integration marketplace look native to your application.

The embedded marketplace showcases your integration offerings and allows customers to self-activate and configure the integrations they need. Just as previously, you can specify which integrations appear in your marketplace, which ones can be self-activated, and define each integration's configuration screen.

Your customers do not need to juggle another set of credentials to access your embedded marketplace. Instead, you can sign JSON web tokens (JWTs) for your users, which can be used to automatically authenticate them for the marketplace.

Check out our [docs](/docs/composer/builder/embedding-marketplace.mdx) to get started.

### Configurable Webhook Endpoints

You now have more control over how webhook endpoints are configured for deployed instances.
You already had the option to create a webhook endpoint for each flow of each deployed instance (**Instance and Flow-Specific**).
You can now select two other configuration options:

- **Instance-Specific**: Create a single webhook endpoint for each instance.
  Identify which of the instances' flows should run based on data in the webhook request.
- **Shared**: Create a single webhook that is shared by all customers who have a particular integration.
  Route the webhook request to a flow in a specific customer's instance based on data in the webhook request.

Both of these additional configuration options allows you to route webhook requests to a particular customer and flow based on the data that comes in to the webhook.
If the data that comes in needs additional processing, or if you need to look up a flow's name or customer's ID, you can assign one of your integration's flows to be a **Preprocess Flow** - a flow that's run when a webhook is invoked and aids in making sure the request gets to the right place.

For more information, check out our [webhook docs](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-endpoint-configuration) and [Shared Webhook Quickstart](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/using-shared-webhooks-and-preprocess-flows.mdx).

### Granular Permissions for Third Parties

You can now invite third-party vendors to log in to Builder with limited access to your integrations, custom components, and customers.
This is helpful if you need to collaborate on a new integration with a third-party vendor.
You can grant them **view** or **edit** access to a particular integration or set of custom components, which allows them to test the integration against their app or service.
You can debug and iterate faster on integration and custom component development, and can have one central place to view logs and test runs.
You can also view logs of each test a third-party vendor performs to give you a sense of how their side of the integration development is progressing.

Permissions are granular - third-party users only see what they've been given permissions to see.
So, if you're integrating with two competing companies, or even with one of your competitors, they are not given insight into the other integrations, custom components, or customers you have in your Builder account.

### Multi-Flow Integrations

Builder now provides full support for multi-flow integrations!

Integrations can now include multiple **flows**. (A flow is a trigger and a series of steps.) This enables you to provide your customers with a complex third-party integration that performs multiple related tasks, but is packaged and deployed as a single integration.

For example, you might integrate with an ERP that sends a variety of data via webhooks to your application (a webhook when inventory is updated, a webhook when customer info is updated, and so on). Rather than constructing integrations with complex branches or assembling multiple integrations, you can now create a single integration with flows that handle each type of webhook payload. You would create a flow to handle inventory updates, another flow to handle customer updates, and deploy all of those flows together as a single instance to a customer.

Each flow has its own trigger (so it gets its own webhook URL), and flows are tested and run independently of one another.

When customers or customer-facing teams deploy a multi-flow integration, they configure and deploy all of the flows at once using a single configuration screen.

Your existing integrations will continue to operate as expected. Please note:

1. The **Selected Test Run** dropdown has been moved to the input reference selector.
   When configuring an input for a step, you can select which test run to preview outputs for within the **Reference** tab.
   <Screenshot
     filename="changelog/selected-test-run.png"
     maxWidth="400px"
     alt="Select test run in Builder app"
   />
2. Builder's CLI, Prism, has been updated to version 3.0.0 to account for this change.
   To install the latest Prism, run:
   ```bash
   npm install --global @prismatic-io/prism
   ```
3. The YAML that defines integrations has been updated.
   See the [Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/integrations.mdx#yaml-definition) docs article.

Check out our [building integrations](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx#flows-in-integrations) page for more information.

### Deploy-Time Triggers

You can now configure integration flows with triggers that are invoked when an instance is deployed to a customer. This is helpful if you have a set of “initialization” tasks that need to be completed _once_ to set up a customer’s instance.

A deploy-time flow could enable features in a third-party app, set up third-party users or permissions, create a directory structure in a file storage system, or even set up webhooks in a third-party application to point to the instance’s other flows.

### Enhanced Versioning for Components, Integrations, and Instances

Versioning has been improved for components, integrations, and instances to give you more fine-grained control over exactly what code is deployed to customers.

**Components** are now assigned an integer version that increments each time the component is published.
If a custom component is at "version 3" and you publish a new component definition, that new definition gets "version 4".
This allows you to update or extend components without unintentionally impacting existing integrations that use them, ensuring your integrations remain stable.
Integration builders can then update the component versions used in their integrations, or roll back to a previous versions when desired, and will be notified when newer versions of components are available.

Read more about [Versioning of Components](/docs/composer/builder/components.mdx#component-versioning) and [Choosing Components Versions in Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx#choosing-component-versions).

**Integration** versioning has been improved, giving you more control over what versions of integrations you deploy to customers.
When you publish new changes to an integration, similar to components, your integration is assigned a new version number.
Then, when you deploy an instance to a customer, you can choose which version of the integration to use.
That means you can have some customers on version 1, and others on version 2 as needed, giving you control over which customers have what, and allowing you to test a new integration version with a small subset of your customer base before deploying it broadly.

Rolling back an instance deployment is a breeze - if you deploy a new version of an integration to a customer and something seems off, you can easily roll back your instance to a known working version of the integration with just a couple of clicks.

As always, updating customers' instances can be scripted, so you don't need to manually deploy a new version of an integration to each customer.

### Generate Custom Components From API Specs

APIs often have hundreds of unique endpoints that you can interact with.
With the release of [Prism](/docs/composer/builder/cli/cli-usage.mdx) version 1.0.8, you can now generate a custom component from a WSDL or OpenAPI file.
That means you can have a custom component for a third-party service with hundreds of actions with a single CLI command.

### Customer Self-Service

It's now easier for your customers to manage instances of integrations that have been deployed to them.
Customer users with **admin** permissions can update config variables and credentials that are associated with their instances.
So, if their config or credentials for a third-party service change, they can log in and make the change without needing your help.

### Intuitive Instance Deployment

Significant improvements have been made to credentials, integration configuration and instance deployment.

Integration builders now have the ability to create an easy-to-use configuration page for customer-facing teams.

### Retry and Replay

Organizations with a professional or enterprise plan can now configure instances to [automatically retry](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx#integration-retry-configuration) if an execution fails.
You can control how many times an instance attempts to run with the same input, and how long it should wait between failed attempts.
If you have an integration that relies on a flaky third-party API, for example, this minimizes interruptions for both your customers and your team.

You can also [replay](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx#instance-execution-retry-and-replay) - manually retry - a specific failed execution of an instance.

### Invoking Instances Synchronously

You can now choose to invoke your instances [synchronously or asynchronously](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#synchronous-and-asynchronous-integrations).
When you invoke an instance synchronously, your request says open until the instance completes, and results from the instance's run are returned as an HTTP response.
