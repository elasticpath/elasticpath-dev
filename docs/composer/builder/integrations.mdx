When you build an integration, you can build it in the [low-code designer](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx), or as a TypeScript project in your favorite IDE.
We call an integration built with code a [code-native integration](/docs/composer/builder/code-native-integrations.mdx) (or CNI).

An **integration** built with the low-code builder consists of a series of **steps** that execute one after another in series.
Each step runs an [action](/docs/composer/builder/components.mdx#component-actions) - a small bit of code designed to perform a specific task.
Actions can be things like "HTTP - GET" to fetch the contents of a webpage from the internet, or "Amazon S3 - Put Object" to save a file to Amazon S3.
You can use a combination of actions from common [built-in components](/docs/composer/builder/builder-components/component-catalog.mdx) and your own [custom components](/docs/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx) to build an integration.

A code-native **integration** is a set of flows written in TypeScript that run when a trigger fires.

An integration is started when its **trigger** fires.
Triggers can either follow a [schedule](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#scheduled-triggers), or can be invoked via a [webhook URL](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-triggers).

Integrations should be developed to be **configuration-driven**, so they can be deployed to multiple customers with potentially different configurations.
That is accomplished by leveraging [config variables](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx#config-variables-in-integrations), and have configuring steps to reference those variables.

Many integrations have a single **flow**.
That is, they have a single trigger that fires, and a single set of steps that are executed one after another.
Builder also supports grouping multiple related flows together into a single deployable integration.
For example, if you have a third-party service (Acme ERP) that sends data via a variety of webhooks to your integrations, it probably makes sense to have a single Acme Corp integration that you or your customers deploy that is made up of several logical flows.
Each flow has its own trigger, though they all share config variables.

When an integration is completed, it can be [published](#publishing-an-integration).
[Customers](/docs/composer/builder/customers.mdx) can then enable the integration for themselves through the [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx), or your team members can deploy an [instance](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx) of the integration on the customer's behalf.
Regardless of who enables an instance of the integration - your team member or your customer - the person deploying the instance configures the instance with customer-specific config variables.

We recommend that you follow our [Getting Started](/docs/composer/builder/getting-started/what-is-builder.mdx) tutorials to first acquaint yourself with integration development and deployment.

## When to use code-native vs low-code

The Builder low-code designer and code-native SDK are both great tools for building integrations, and each has advantages.
You may want to reach for the low-code designer when:

- Your team is looking to save dev time and has non-dev resources that are technical enough to build integrations.
- It is important to your non-developer team members to have a visual representation of the integration.
- You would like your customers to build their own integrations using [embedded designer](/docs/composer/builder/embedded-designer.mdx).

You might want to use CNI when:

- You have a highly technical team that is comfortable writing TypeScript.
- Your integration requires complex logic that is easier to write in code.
- You want to unit test entire integrations rather than individual actions and triggers.
- You want to use a version control system to manage your integration code.

Your team can build both low-code and code-native integrations in the same account.
Some integrations may lend themselves to one or the other, and both low-code and code-native integrations can coexist in your integration marketplace - your customers won't know the difference between a low-code and code-native integration.

## Creating a new integration

<ExampleTabs>
<TabItem value='webapp'>

To create a new integration in the web app, click **Integrations** from the left-side menu, and then click the **+ Add Integration** button in the upper-right.

When you create a new integration you have a few options:

- You can create a **blank** integration from scratch by selecting **Quickstart**.
- Behind the scenes, integrations are saved as [YAML definitions](#yaml-definition).
  You can load a YAML file from your clipboard or from a file by selecting **Import**.
- You can start from an existing [template](#integration-templates) - you can create your own template, or you can select a Builder-built example template.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/configure-new-integration.png"
  alt="Configure a new integration"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>

You will be prompted to give your integration a **name** and a trigger for the first flow of your integration.
The trigger is what will cause one of your integration's flows to run, and you can change your trigger at any time.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/new-integration-name.png"
  alt="Add integration in Builder app"
  maxWidth="620px"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli'>

To create a new integration from the command line, use the `integrations:create` subcommand.

```bash
prism integrations:create \
    --name 'Send a .rocket render to the 3D printer' \
    --description 'Fetch a .rocket file, convert it to AutoCAD, and queue the print job'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='api'>

Use the [createIntegration](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/createIntegration.mdx) mutation to create a new integration:

```graphql
mutation {
  createIntegration(
    input: {
      name: "Send a .rocket render to the 3D printer"
      description: "Fetch a .rocket file, convert it to AutoCAD, and queue the print job"
    }
  ) {
    integration {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</ExampleTabs>

For more information:
[Building Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx),
[Testing Integrations](/docs/composer/builder/testing-integrations.mdx)

## Integration templates

Some of your integrations will look similar to one another.
For example, if you are importing opportunities and accounts from a dozen CRM vendors, the steps that fetch data will be unique, but the steps that send data to your app will always look the same.
Rather than developing those common steps over and over, it saves time to create an integration template that you and your team can start from when you build additional similar integrations.

To turn your integration into a template, first [publish](#publishing-an-integration) a version of your integration.
Then, open the **Integration details** modal and select **Available as Template**.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/available-as-template.png"
  alt="Create a new template of an integration"
  maxWidth="650px"
/>

You can choose if the template is just for org users, or if you offer [embedded designer](/docs/composer/builder/embedded-designer.mdx) you can make the template available to customer integration builders.

## Assigning an icon to an integration

Integrations can be assigned icons, to make them more presentable in the [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx).
To assign an icon to an integration from the integration designer by clicking the icon to the left of your integration's name:

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/add-icon.png"
  maxWidth="400px"
  alt="Add icon to integration in Builder app"
/>

Square PNG images that are at least 400 pixels wide look best as integration icons.

## Integration labels

Labels help you keep your integrations organized.
You can assign any number of labels to an integration from within the integration designer by opening the **Integration details** menu:

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/labels.png"
  maxWidth="500px"
  alt="Assign labels to integration in Builder app"
/>

You can [search](#listing-and-searching-integrations) for integrations by label.
_Note_: for consistency, labels are always lower-cased.

Labels applied to published integration versions appear in the version dropdown menu on an instance configuration page.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/label-versions-instance.png"
  maxWidth="700px"
  alt="Versions and labels for instance configuration in Builder app"
/>

## Listing and searching integrations

<ExampleTabs>
<TabItem value='webapp'>

To view all of the integrations your organization has created, click the **Integrations** link on the left-hand sidebar.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/list-integrations.png"
  alt="All integrations for organization in Builder app"
/>

You can search for specific integrations by name by typing a part of the name in the upper search bar, or you can search by **description**, **[category](#categorizing-integrations)**, **[labels](#integration-labels)** or **marketplace availability** by clicking the **Filter** button to the right of the search bar.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/search-integrations.png"
  alt="Filter integrations in Builder app"
  maxWidth="800px"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli'>

To list all integrations your organization has created, use the `prism integrations:list` subcommand.

```bash
prism integrations:list

 Name                                    Description                                                          Version
 ─────────────────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ──────
 Deploy Model to Manufacturer            Upload a model of a rocket to the manufacturers                      1
 Engine Schematics in Wind Tunnel        Deploy Engine Schematics to Wind Tunnel for Testing                  3
 Example Integration                     Example                                                              2
 Send a .rocket render to the 3D printer Fetch a .rocket file, convert it to AutoCAD, and queue the print job 12
 Fabricate 3D Model                      Queue a 3D printing of a rocket model from AutoCAD                   8
```

Additional flags are available for this subcommand to filter results, format output, or show additional information

```bash
prism integrations:list --filter 'Name=Fabricate 3D Model' --output json --extended

[
  {
    "id": "SW50ZWdyYXRpb246NDkxMDY0OWUtNWVhOC00M2Y3LTk3ODgtMDhlZGI2Y2I3MWVl",
    "name": "Fabricate 3D Model",
    "description": "Send 3D rendering of rocket for fabrication",
    "versionNumber": "3"
  }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='api'>

List integrations by querying [integrations](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/query/integrations.mdx):

```graphql
query {
  integrations {
    nodes {
      id
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</ExampleTabs>

## Categorizing integrations

Integrations can be assigned a "category" for easy sorting and filtering.
For example, you might have a dozen "ERP" integrations, a few "Inventory Management" integrations, etc.
Assigning each integration a category allows your team, as well as your customers in the [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx) to view integrations sorted by category.

You can set a category for an integration by clicking the **Integration details** button on the top-left of the integration designer:

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/edit-integration-category.png"
  maxWidth="500px"
  alt="Set category for integration in Builder app"
/>

## Publishing an integration

By **publishing** an integration, you mark it ready for deployment to customers.

<ExampleTabs>
<TabItem value='webapp'>

To publish an integration, first open the **Version history** tab on the left side of the page.
If you have unpublished changes you'll see an **Unpublished Draft** listed among the integration's versions.
Type a note about the changes you made to the integration, and then click **Save & Publish** to release a new version of your integration:

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/version-history.png"
  maxWidth="550px"
  alt="Publish integration in Builder app"
/>

Integration versions can be marked **Available** or **Unavailable** by toggling the blue toggles to the right of integration versions.
Marking an integration version **Unavailable** prevents that version from being deployed as an [instance](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx#deploying-instances) to a customer.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli'>

Within the CLI tool, you can publish an integration using the `integrations:publish` subcommand.
You can add an optional description detailing how this publication changed.

```bash
prism integrations:publish \
  ${INTEGRATION_ID} \
  --comment "Updated XML output format to exclude SSN and other PII fields."
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='api'>

To publish an integration, use the [publishIntegration](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/publishIntegration.mdx) mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  publishIntegration(
    input: {
      id: "SW50ZWdyYXRpb246MzgxYzFmMjgtMjQwYy00OTRiLWE0NTMtZjJiOWRmZTg4NThj"
      comment: "Added ERP export functionality"
    }
  ) {
    integration {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</ExampleTabs>

## Deploying an integration

Once an integration has been [published](#publishing-an-integration), an instance of the integration can be configured and deployed to a customer.
See the [instances](/docs/composer/builder/instances.mdx) article for information on deploying instances of integrations.

You can also enable your customers to deploy integrations themselves, using Builder's [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx).

## Viewing deployed instances

To view all instances that have been deployed, click the **Instances** tab from the integration designer screen.
This screen will display customers to which this integration has been deployed.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/list-instances.png"
  alt="List of deployed instances in Builder app"
  maxWidth="550px"
/>

The version of this integration that is deployed to each customer is shown within this drawer.

## Forking an integration

Sometimes you will want to make a copy of an integration and modify the copy.
This is called _forking_ an integration.

<ExampleTabs>
<TabItem value='webapp'>

From the integration designer, click the <Icon>settings</Icon> icon on the top left of the page.
Then, click **Duplicate Integration**.
Give your forked integration a new name and description and then click **ADD**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli'>

To fork an integration, use the `prism integrations:fork` subcommand and pass in the ID of the integration you want to fork:

```bash
prism integrations:fork ${INTEGRATION_ID} \
  --name "Customer Import from XML" \
  --description "Import customers from XML instead of JSON"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='api'>

Fork an integration using the [forkIntegration](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/forkIntegration.mdx) mutation.
The `parent` is the ID of the integration you want to fork:

```graphql
mutation {
  forkIntegration(
    input: {
      parent: "SW50ZWdyYXRpb246MzgxYzFmMjgtMjQwYy00OTRiLWE0NTMtZjJiOWRmZTg4NThj"
      name: "My new integration"
      description: "A fork of my old integration!"
    }
  ) {
    integration {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</ExampleTabs>

## Deleting an integration

:::note Deleting an integration will delete all instances of that integration
Use caution when deleting an integration.
Deletion of an integration also deletes all deployed instances of that integration.
:::

<ExampleTabs>
<TabItem value='webapp'>

From the integration designer, click the **Integration details** button on the left of the page.
Then, select **Remove integration**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='cli'>

```bash
# Fetch the integration's ID
INTEGRATION_ID=$(prism integrations:list --filter 'Name=Deploy Model to Manufacturer' --columns id --no-header)

# Delete the integration
prism integrations:delete ${INTEGRATION_ID}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='api'>

Delete an integration using the [deleteIntegration](/docs/composer/builder/api/schema/mutation/deleteIntegration.mdx) mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteIntegration(
    input: {
      id: "SW50ZWdyYXRpb246NjQxY2RhMmEtNzkwMi00YjYzLWJjZGEtMmE3NTk0Yzk1YTAy"
    }
  ) {
    integration {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</ExampleTabs>

## Integration attachments

Your team can save and share integration-related documents alongside an integration by clicking on the **Documentation & attachments** button on the left side of the integration designer.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/attachments.png"
  alt="Add attachments to integration in Builder app"
  maxWidth="550px"
/>

## Internal integration documentation

It's helpful to share documentation, specs and notes about an integration with your team members.
You can add internal (non-customer-facing) notes and documentation to an integration by clicking the **Documentation & attachments** button on the left-hand side of the integration designer.
Here, you can share notes, links, and other documentation with your team members.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/integration-documentation.png"
  alt="Add internal documentation to integration in Builder app"
  maxWidth="550px"
/>

## YAML definition

Behind the scenes, integrations are represented in YAML.
You can view the YAML that defines your integration's flows, steps, inputs, connections and config variables by clicking **Integration details** button at the top-left of the integration designer, and selecting **View YAML**.

<Screenshot
  filename="integrations/yaml-definition.png"
  alt="YAML for integration in Builder app"
/>

If you are exporting the integration and importing it in a different region (US -> EU, for example), make sure you click a **latest component versions** button, as component versions may not match between regions.

:::tip Tip: Spot changes to integrations
The YAML present in this drawer corresponds to the integration that is currently being displayed.
You can view the YAML of a previous version of the integration by first opening the **VERSION HISTORY** drawer and selecting an older integration version.

If you want to spot differences between an older version of your integration and the current version, you can compare the YAML definition of the older version with the YAML definition of the current version using your favorite diff tool (VSCode has a great built-in [diff tool](https://vscode.one/diff-vscode/)).
:::

### Exporting an integration

Once you've opened the **Integration details** modal in the integration designer, you can click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the integration's YAML definition into your clipboard, so you can paste it into an editor of your choice.
You can also click **Save to file** to download a copy of your integration.

If you are using Builder's command line tool, `prism`, you can use the [`integrations:export`](/docs/composer/builder/cli/prism.mdx#integrationsexport) subcommand to similarly export the YAML definition of your integration.

### Importing an integration

If you have a YAML definition of your integration saved in your clipboard, you can click **Load from clipboard** to replace your current integration with the definition that you have copied.
Or, you can save a modified YAML file to your computer, and load the YAML definition by clicking **Load from file** and selecting the file you saved.

If you are using `prism`, you can use the [`integrations:import`](/docs/composer/builder/cli/prism.mdx#integrationsimport) subcommand to import a YAML definition of your integration.

### Renaming flows and config variables in YAML definitions

:::warning Use caution when modifying flow names or config variable names in YAML
If you modify the name of a flow or config variable in the YAML definition, you should include a `renameAttributes` section in your YAML.
:::

Your integration is made of flows, steps, config variables, and some other metadata, and can be represented as a YAML file.
When a YAML file is imported, the Builder API attempts to match flows and config variables in the YAML with flows and config variables in the existing integration.
If a match is found, the existing config variable or flow will remain.
If no match is found, a new config variable or flow will be created and the old flow or config variable will be removed.

This presents problems if you want to rename flows or config variables in your YAML definition:

- If you rename a **flow**, the Builder API will not be able to match the flow in the YAML with a flow in the existing integration, and will create a new flow and delete the old one.
  Your integration will functionally be the same, but the flow's ID behind the scenes will be different.
  Instances of your integration will be assigned new webhook URLs for the renamed flow when the instance is updated to the latest integration version.
  Different webhook URLs can cause issues if you already have webhooks configured using the old flow's URL.
- If you rename a **config variable**, the Builder API will not be able to match the config variable in the YAML with the config variable in the existing integration, and will create a new config variable and delete the old one.
  This will cause issues if you have already configured instances of your integration.
  When a customer updates their instance, their old config variables will be removed and new ones will need be reconfigured (this includes OAuth 2.0 connections - the customer user will need to reauthenticate their connection).

To ensure that the Builder API matches the flow or config variable in the YAML with the flow or config variable in the existing integration, you should include a `renameAttributes` section in your YAML.
This section includes `requiredConfigVars` and `flows` sections, which outline the old and new names of config variables and flows, respectively.

```yaml {15,19,24,29-37}
configPages:
  - elements:
      - type: configVar
        value: SFDC Connection
      - type: configVar
        value: SFDC Record Type
    name: Page 1
    userLevelConfigured: false
definitionVersion: 7
endpointType: flow_specific
flows:
  - description: ""
    endpointSecurityType: customer_optional
    isSynchronous: false
    name: SFDC Data Import
    steps: []
name: SFDC Integration
requiredConfigVars:
  - key: SFDC Record Type
    description: ""
    dataType: string
    orgOnly: false
    defaultValue: ""
  - key: SFDC Connection
    description: ""
    dataType: string
    orgOnly: false
    defaultValue: ""
renameAttributes:
  requiredConfigVars:
    - newName: SFDC Connection
      oldName: Salesforce Connection
    - newName: SFDC Record Type
      oldName: Salesforce Record Type
  flows:
    - newName: SFDC Data Import
      oldName: Salesforce Data Import
```

In the above example, we renamed the flow `Salesforce Data Import` to `SFDC Data Import`, and renamed the config variable `Salesforce Connection` to `SFDC Connection` and `Salesforce Record Type` to `SFDC Record Type`.
With this block included, the Builder API will know to match the old flow and config variable names with the new flow and config variable names, and will not replace flows or config variables with new ones.
