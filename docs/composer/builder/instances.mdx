An **instance** of an [integration](/docs/composer/builder/integrations.mdx) is a copy of an integration that has been configured for a specific [customer](/docs/composer/builder/customers.mdx).
When the instance is configured for a customer or by a customer, config variables and connections to third-party apps and services specific to that customer are set by walking through a [configuration wizard](/docs/composer/builder/configuration-wizard.mdx).

You can deploy instances of the integrations you create [on behalf of your customers](/docs/composer/builder/org-deployed-instances.mdx) or your customers can enable instances themselves through the [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx).
For your customers, **instance** doesn't have any meaning - they either have an integration or they don't. So, when customers log in to Builder they're presented phrases like "activate this integration", or "configure this integration". A customer "activates" an "integration" - which is the same as deploying an "instance" in your lingo as an organization user.

When a [flow](/docs/composer/builder/building-integrations.mdx#flows-in-integrations) within an instance is triggered, an [execution](/docs/composer/builder/executions.mdx) of your instance's flow runs.

## What happens when an instance is deployed

Once an instance is deployed, any triggers that are marked as [deploy triggers](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#instance-deploy-trigger) are executed.
Note: the instance will still deploy even if a deploy trigger fails to run to completion.
We recommend adding an [alert monitor](/docs/composer/builder/monitoring-and-alerting.mdx#alert-monitors) to instances you deploy, so you can be alerted if an execution (a deploy flow included) fails to run to completion.

Webhooks are generated for each flow and can be invoked after the instance is deployed.
Schedule triggers are registered with the Builder scheduler and will run at the interval you specify.

Instances are billed based on how long the instance is enabled.
You are not billed when an instance is paused.

## Invoking instances

An instance's flows can be invoked one of three ways:

1. You can set up your integration to run [on a schedule](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#scheduled-triggers)
1. You can invoke them [through a webhook](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-triggers)
1. You can configure your flow to run [on deployment](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#instance-deploy-trigger) or [on instance removal](/docs/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#instance-remove-trigger)

### Invoking instances with webhook triggers

If you choose to invoke your instance's flows with a webhook trigger, webhook URLs will be generated for each flow you when you deploy the instance.

To invoke an instance's flow programmatically, you can send a POST request to the webhook URL with an optional payload.
Here's an example using `curl`, though you can use any language you like:

```bash
curl 'https://hooks.us-east-2.elasticpathintegrations.com/trigger/EXAMPLE==' \
  --location \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"examplePayloadKey": "examplePayloadValue"}'
```

## Searching instances across customers

Click the **Instances** link on the left-hand sidebar to view all instances for all customers.
You can search instance names through the **Search Instances** search bar on the top of the page.
You can further filter instances by description, integration or labels by clicking the **Filter** link to the right of the search bar.

**How do I filter instances by customer?**

To view instances for a specific customer, click the **Customers** link on the left-hand sidebar and select a customer.
Select the **Instances** tab to view instances for that customer.

## Options for deploying instances

<Vimeo video="894996278" title="Options for deploying an instance" />

Once you've built and published an integration it's time to configure and deploy an instance of your integration to a customer.
You can either deploy the instance yourself, or grant your customer access to deploy the instance themselves.

### Option 1: Deploy an instance yourself

As you work with your first few customers and build out an MVP, it may be easiest to [deploy instances yourself](/docs/composer/builder/org-deployed-instances.mdx).

**Advantages**:

- You can quickly iterate on your integration and fix any production issues that arise.
- No additional development work is required to support self-deployment.

**Disadvantages**:

- You'll need to manually deploy instances for each customer.
- You'll possibly need to handle the customers' credentials for the third-party service as you configure the instance.

### Option 2: Grant customers access to deploy instances through the Builder app

You can invite your customers to log in to Builder and deploy instances themselves.
You can do this by publishing your integration to the [integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/integration-marketplace.mdx) and then invite the [customer user](/docs/composer/builder/users.mdx#managing-customer-users) to your tenant.
The customer user will only be able to see instances that are deployed to them (and not to your other customers).

**Advantages**:

- Your customer can configure deploy instances themselves.
- You don't need to handle the customers' credentials for the third-party service.

**Disadvantages**:

- Your customer will need an additional login to Builder.

### Option 3: Embed the integration marketplace in your app

You can [embed the integration marketplace](/docs/composer/builder/embedding-marketplace.mdx) in your app so that your customers can deploy instances without leaving your app.

**Advantages**:

- Customers can deploy instances for themselves without leaving your app.
- You can leverage your existing authentication system to authenticate customers.
- You have some control over the fonts, colors and other styling of the marketplace, so you can make the embedded iframe match your app.

**Disadvantages**:

- Some development work is required to embed the marketplace in your app (though, the Builder embedded SDK makes this easy!).

### Option 4: Build your own UI for deploying instances

If you want to build a custom UI for deploying instances, you can use the Builder embedded SDK to [make API requests](/docs/composer/builder/embedded-api-requests.mdx) to the Builder API on behalf of your customer user.
You can query for integrations in the integration marketplace, components, etc., and can map those records to custom UI elements in your app.

**Advantages**:

- You have full control over the UI and can build a custom UI that fits your app's look and feel.

**Disadvantages**:

- This option requires the most development work.

## Configuring instances

When you or your customer deploy an instance, you will work through the [Configuration Wizard](/docs/composer/builder/configuration-wizard.mdx) that your integration builders created.

This is where you can set values for connections and configuration variables for your deployed instance.
If your integration developers set default values for the config variables, those will be set initially, but you can override them if you choose.
Depending on config variable type, you'll have the option to toggle boolean values, enter string values, enter JSON or XML for a code config variable, or select options from a dropdown.

Be sure to click **Save and deploy** on the last page of the **Configuration Wizard** to save any changes you make.
