You can quickly and easily integrate Commerce with Avalara using the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager. Using Avalara Integration, you can commit tax and void tax on specific order events. 

Order changes in Commerce, like creating, fulfilling, and canceling, generate webhook events that cause orders to be created, fulfilled, and canceled in Avalara. The following Commerce event types can be used to generate webhook events.

- `order.created`
- `order.fulfilled`
- `order.paid`
- `order.authorized`
- `order.cancelled`

When integrating with third-party providers, we recommend you use the closest region in the third-party service to reduce latency as much as possible. See [Regions and URLs table](/guides/Getting-Started/elastic-path-domains#regions-and-ur-ls).
