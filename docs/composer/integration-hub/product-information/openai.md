You can integrate Commerce with OpenAI quickly by adding your credentials and deploying the OpenAI Product Description Rewrite integration in **Integrations Hub** of Commerce Manager. Using the OpenAI Product Description Rewrite integration, you can rewrite your Commerce product descriptions. Using the instructions you provide, OpenAI drafts a new product description and adds it to an extended field on your product. 

## Collecting Your Setup Information

Before you begin configuring your integration in Commerce Manager, you need to collect the necessary setup information from OpenAI and Commerce Manager.

:::caution
Collect the following information and make sure you have it available, for example, in a text file, before configuring your integration in Commerce Manager. If you leave the Integration page in Commerce Manager, the integration is not saved and you must remove the integration and create a new one.

## Using the Integration

To rewrite a product description: 

1. From the OpenAI Description Rewrite integration, select **Test**.
1. In **Payload body**, enter the product ID of the products whose description you want to update. You can only rewrite one product's description at a time. 

    ```json
     {
       "product": {
     		"product_id": "b8e9af84-69f9-472c-ad18-57557e1d2c75"
   	      }
     }
    ```
    
    You can get a product's ID from the [Products page](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/view-product-details) in Commerce Manager or using the [Get all Products](/docs/api/pxm/products/get-all-products) endpoint.

1. Click **Save & Run Test**.
1. When the test has finished, go to your store to see your extended product descriptions. 
1. To rewrite the product description of another product, amend the **ai_instructions**, add a new product ID to the **Payload body** and run **Test** again.
