You can integrate Commerce quickly and easily using the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager. Integrations allow you to integrate with third-party providers, such as site search integrations, with just a few clicks. 


:::note
When integrating with third-party providers, we recommend you use the closest region in the third-party service to reduce latency as much as possible. See [Regions and URLs table](/docs/commerce-cloud/api-overview/elastic-path-domains#regions-and-ur-ls).
