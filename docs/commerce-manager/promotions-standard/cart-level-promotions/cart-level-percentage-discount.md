:::caution
- The **Promotion Exclusions** setting specifies the products to be excluded from the cart-level promotions, such as `fixed_discount` and `percent_discount`. However, the stores that use [simple calculation method](/docs/api/settings/settings-introduction#calculation-method) do not support excluding products from promotions.
- We recommend to use **Advanced (Conditions v2)** settings.
