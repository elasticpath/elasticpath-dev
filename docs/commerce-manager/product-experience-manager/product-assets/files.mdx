The supported upload file type formats are:

- .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .mov
- .mpg .mp4, .mp3, .aac
- .vrml, .vr
- .doc(x), ppt(x), xls(x), pdf

By default, the maximum file size is 8 Megabytes. If you need to support larger file sizes, contact your Elastic Path representative.

Delete files by selecting the Trash can icon next to the listing.
