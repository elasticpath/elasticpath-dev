If you want to modify product attributes, export the products in Commerce Manager. This builds a [Comma Separated Values (CSV)](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-export#product-export-csv-file) file containing the product entries, main image files, and custom extension data. 

Each row in a `.csv` file represents a product. A `.csv` file can contain up to 50,000 products. If you want to export more than 50,000 products, you must have a separate `.csv` file and export products to each `.csv` file, one at a time.

After the file is exported, you get a link to the location where the `.csv` file is stored. Then you can make changes to the product fields (modify product information, add main image files, and custom extension data) using product import. For more information, see [Import Products Overview](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/product-import/product-importer).

1. On the **Products** page, select the checkboxes next to the products that you want to modify. You may apply appropriate filters to select the products.
2. Click the arrow next to the checkbox on the header row and then click **Export Products**.
