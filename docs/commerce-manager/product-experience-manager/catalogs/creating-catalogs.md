1. (Optional) Your catalog can have up to 5 price books. This is useful, for example, if you want price books for seasonal sales, reward programs or different pricing for business and retail customers. Click **Add another Price Book**. 
1. If you have multiple price books, you must specify a priority for your price books. Product prices are displayed in the catalog according to the priority of the price books. Enter the order of your price books in **Priority**, where the price book with the highest priority is listed first. You can specify any numbers that you want. For example, 1, 2, 3 or 100, 90, 80, and so on.
1. Select the additional price book you want your catalog to use. 
1. Repeat steps 6-8 for each price book you want to add.
