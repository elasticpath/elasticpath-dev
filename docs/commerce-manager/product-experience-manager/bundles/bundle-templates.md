You can add templates to your bundles. Templates are a collection of attributes. Attributes are grouped together to match a particular product type or to provide an input for other purposes, such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or product specification. For example, a _Book_ template might contain the attributes, such as _ISBN_, _Author_, _Number of pages_, _Year Published_, or _Condition (New/Used)_. See [Product Templates](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/extending-products/templates)

Ensure that at least one template is available in the store.
