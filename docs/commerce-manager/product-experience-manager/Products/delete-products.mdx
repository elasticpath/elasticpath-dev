Deleting a product removes the product information and the associated media files from the database. However, the product references are not deleted from the price books that consist of the product information. You must republish the catalog to update the catalog release with the changes. If you want to keep your hierarchies and price books up to date, remove the deleted products from those resources.

Even after deleting a product, an order history that has the product still keeps the product information of the deleted product, such as, the product SKU, product ID, and price. However, clicking the product does not take a shopper to the product details.

To delete a product, in the **Product Experience Manager > Products** page, click **...** and click **Delete**.

:::tip
To remove products from the catalog and still keep them in the database for audit purposes, set the product status to draft instead of deleting it. Additionally, remove the product from hierarchies, and republish the affected catalogs so that it does not appear in the storefront.
