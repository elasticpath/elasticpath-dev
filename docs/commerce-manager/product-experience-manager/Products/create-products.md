# Prerequisite

- Ensure that you have [created at least one price book](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#creating-price-books).

## Best practises

- [Create at least one template with attributes](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/add-product-templates) before creating a product.
- [Create at least one variation with options and required modifiers to build child products](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/variations/assign-variations-build-child-products) before creating a product.

The following steps provide a high-level procedure to complete a product configuration:

1. In the **Product Experience Manager > Products** page, click **Create New**.
1. In the [**Product Details**](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/add-product-details) tab, enter the product details.
1. You can allow your shoppers to add custom text to a product if you have products, like T-shirts or greeting cards that can be printed with your shoppers [personalized messages](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/personalizing-products). 
1. In the **Product Templates** tab, add [templates](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/add-product-templates) for the product.
1. In the **Pricing** tab, configure the [pricing settings](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/configure-product-price) for the product.
1. In the **Variations** tab, associate [variations](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/variations/assign-variations-build-child-products) with the product and [build child products](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/variations/assign-variations-build-child-products) with the variations and options.
1. In the **Inventory** tab, [manage the product inventory](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/configure-product-price).
1. In the **Media Management** tab, upload the [product images](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/manage-product-media).

You can use **Back** and **Next** buttons to navigate through the tabs and the **Save & Exit** button to save the changes and exit the window any time.
