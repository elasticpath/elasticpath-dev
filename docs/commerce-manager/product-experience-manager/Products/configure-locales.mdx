You can localize product names and descriptions when creating your products. 

By default, there are a number of language codes available. You activate locales in Commerce Manager in [**SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locales**]( /docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/locales/). You can activate a maximum of five languages. 

You can also add your own custom language codes if the language that you want to use is not available in [**SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locales**]( /docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/locales/). You can do this using the [create a product](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product) API request. Locales that are added using the [Create a product](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product) API request are available in Commerce Manager under **Custom Product Locales**.

1. In the **Product Details** tab, expand **Locale** drop-down list. The languages you have activated in [**SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locale**]( /docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/locales/) are displayed.
1. Select the language you want to use. If the language you want is not available, perform the following steps.

    1. Go to **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locales** to find and activatd the language you want.
    1. If the language you want is not shown in **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locales** then add a custom locale using [create a product](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
