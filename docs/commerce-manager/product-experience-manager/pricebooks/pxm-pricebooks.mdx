A price book contains the prices for the products in a catalog. Catalogs with the same hierarchies of products can be associated with different price books. 

A price book contains a list of product SKUs and the prices you want to charge for those products. If your store supports multiple currencies, a price book can contain product prices in each of the supported currencies. See [Manage Currencies in Stores](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/currencies/manage-currencies).

Each catalog must have at least one price book.  A price book can be associated with multiple catalogs. 

You can configure your catalog to have up to 5 price books. Price book stacking allows you to create multiple price books for different scenarios, such as seasonal sales, business versus retail customer pricing, and reward programs. If you have multiple price books, when you create a catalog, you must configure a priority for your price books. Product prices are displayed in the catalog according to the priority of the price books. For example, you may have products that have different prices based on region. You can have a price book with the standard retail pricing and then have a second price book that has different pricing for a different region. See [Create a catalog](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/catalogs/creating-catalogs).

With catalog rules, you can specify when to display these catalogs based on the shopper context. See [Configure Shopper Catalogs](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/catalogs/creating-catalogs) and [Configure Shopper Catalog Rules](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/catalogs/catalog-rules).

You can use price modifiers to change the prices of your child products. By default, child products inherit the same price as their parent products. Using price modifiers, you can enable child products to inherit a different price. For example, this enables you to configure the price of child products to be lower than its parent product, without having to individually update the prices of your child products. There are two types of price modifier.

| Modifier    | Description |
|:------------| :--- |
| `Increment` | Increases the price of a product. |
| `Decrement` | Decreases the price of a product. |

You can create and update product price books and prices in bulk, at both organization and store level, using the Price Book Import API. This is useful, for example, if you have a promotion and want to update 50,000 product prices. Rather than having to go to each price book and manually edit 50,000 prices, you can use the Price Book Import API to bulk update all your product prices at the same time, including setting different prices for different currencies.

In your storefront, the product prices are displayed in the currencies you have configured for your store. If a product in the catalog does not have a price for a currency in the price book, the product is displayed without a price.

## Importing Price Books and Prices

You can create/update:

- price books.
- prices.
   - sales pricing for products and product bundles with SKUs.
   - volume (tiers) pricing.

The following are not supported by the Price Book Import API:

- price modifiers
- SKUless bundles
- Bundle sale prices

Commerce Manager uses a [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) file. The JSONL file can be compressed to a GZIP file. Here is an [example of a JSONL file](/assets/example_file_all.jsonl).

A file can include up to 50,000 objects. If you have more than 50,000 objects, then you must create a separate file, and import each file, one at a time.

1. Go to **Product Experience Manager** > **Price Books**.
2. Select **Import**. Price book imports a processed sequentially in the order that you select **Import**.
3. Browse to the location of your JSONL file.
4. Select your file and click **Open**. A notification indicating whether the operation is successful is displayed. The imported price books and prices are displayed in the **All Price Books** tab. 
5. Select a price book to display the imported/updated prices.
6. The import works on a "best endeavours" approach. In other words, Commerce Manager does its best to create/update the price book objects based on the file that you provide. If there are any errors, then the import is aborted and the job fails with an error. You can then use the results of the job to understand what objects were created/updated up to the point the import failed and to troubleshoot any errors. See [Import Results](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/import-pricebook#tag/Price-Book-Import).

## Creating Price Books
