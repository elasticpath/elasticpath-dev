## Home Page

The Commerce Manager **Home** page provides an option to invite team members to work in your store and to view the API keys for your store.

### Inviting Team Members

Store administrators can invite team members to work on the store configuration. The team member can access the store through Commerce Manager and the API. All team members with the login credentials can log in to Commerce Manager and go to **System > Application Keys** to get their API keys.

A store admin can also invite team members from the **System > Store Settings > Team Management** page.

1. On the **Home** page, enter the email address of the team member you want to invite.
1. Select a role for the team member.

    For more information, see [Roles](/guides/Getting-Started/team-management).

As a store admin, you can revoke access of a team member at any time without changing the settings for other team members. For example, you can revoke access of an external developer working on the store when the contract ends without revoking access of other members in the team.

A store admin can invite registered or unregistered users using their email address. For an unregistered user, the invitation includes a link to the registration form.

1. Click your profile icon at the top-right corner.
1. In the drop-down menu, click **Stores**.

    All stores associated with your account are listed.
