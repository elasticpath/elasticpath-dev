## Creating a Promotion

1. Go to **STORE > Promotions Builder**.

1. Enter the priority number in the **Assign a priority** field. This field determines the order of the stackable promotions that can be applied simultaneously. Each promotion must have a unique priority number. If you assign a priority number that is already in use by another promotion, you will receive an error message.
