### Creating a Single Code

1. Navigate to **STORE > Promotions Builder**.
1. Select the promotion for which you want to create a code.
1. Go to the **Promotion Codes** tab. 
1. (Optional) On the right-hand side, select **Add a new promotion code**.

    The **Add a new promotion code** button is disabled for automatic promotions. To manually create a code, ensure the **Coupon-driven** checkbox is selected while [creating the promotion](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder).
1. In the **Create Single code** tab:
    1. Provide a code in the **Create a code** field.
    1. Choose your audience: 
        - **Public**: The code is available to everyone.
        - **Private**: The code is specific to a particular shopper, so youâ€™ll need to enter their unique identifier.
    1. Set the code type:
        - **Regular code**: A standard code that can be used by any shopper.
        - **First time Shopper code**: A code for shoppers using it for the first time. This option is only available when you set the audience to **Public**.
    1. Define limitations. Choose either **No limitations** or **Add limitations**. This option is only available when you set the code type to **Regular code**.

        If you select **Add limitations**, specify the **Max code use across all checkouts** to control how many times the code can be used overall. Each time a shopper checkouts, the usage is tracked against this number.

        By default, the Commerce Manager uses the per checkout method. However, if you need to limit usage on a `per_application` basis, you can configure this via the backend. See [Creating Promotion codes](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-promotion-codes).
1. Select **Save Changes**.

## Searching for a Promotion Code

    The promotion name associated with the promotion code is displayed.
