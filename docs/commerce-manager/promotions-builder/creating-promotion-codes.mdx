### Creating a Single Code

1. Navigate to **STORE > Promotions Builder**.
1. Select the promotion for which you want to create a code.
1. Go to the **Promotion Codes** tab. 
1. (Optional) On the right-hand side, select **Add a new promotion code**.

    The **Add a new promotion code** button is disabled for automatic promotions. To manually create a code, ensure the **Coupon-driven** checkbox is selected while [creating the promotion](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder).
1. In the **Create Single code** tab:
    1. Provide a code in the **Create a code** field.
    1. Set the audience to **Public** or **Private**.

        If you select **Private**, enter the unique identifier of a specific shopper.

    1. Set the code type to **Regular code** or **First time Shopper code**. This option is only available when you set the audience to **Public**.
    1. Set limitations to **No limitations** or **Add limitations**. This option is only available when you set the code type to **Regular code**.

        If you select **Add limitations**, enter **Max code use across all checkouts**. This defines the maximum number of times the code can be used in total per checkout.

        The Commerce Manager supports only per checkout method. However, the backened supports both `per_application` and `per_checkout` methods. If you need to limit usage by `per_application`, you can configure this via the backend. See [Creating Promotion codes](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-promotion-codes).
1. Select **Save Changes**.

    The promotion name associated with the promotion code is displayed.
