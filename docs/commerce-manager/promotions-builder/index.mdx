The Promotions Builder provides the flexibility to offer diverse discounts to shoppers. Leveraging a rule-based implementation behind the scenes, this feature allows users to set specific promotion eligibility conditions and define corresponding discount actions at various levels.

Within the Promotions Builder, you can configure promotions using various conditions:

- [Cart](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-condition): Define a minimum cart subtotal or quantity requirements.
- [Cart Items](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition): Specify product SKUs, product categories, or products with attributes for eligibility.
- [Custom Attributes](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#adding-cart-custom-attributes): Choose your own cart custom attributes.

Promotions in the Promotions Builder support the following actions:

- [Cart Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-discount-promotion): A cart discount applies to all items in the cart unless specific exclusions are specified. It can be either a fixed discount or a percentage discount.
    - Fixed discount: This reduces the cart total by a fixed amount, such as $5.00 off.
    - Percentage discount: This reduces the cart total by a specific percentage, such as 10% off.
- [Item Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-an-item-discount-promotion): An item discount applies to the eligible items specified in the conditions. It can be a fixed amount, percentage, fixed price, or other discount specified such as **BXGY**.
- [BXGY](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-bxgy-promotion): Buy X and Get Y (BXGY) discounts apply to the items identified within the promotional actions. This means that when a Buy X Get Y promotion is triggered, the specified items receive the associated discounts outlined in the promotion's configuration.
- [Shipping Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-shipping-promotion): Shipping discount applies to eligible shipping groups. The discount applies to the shipping base price, excluding tax and fees.

Exclusions can be applied to any of these conditions and promotions, allowing you to refine your discount strategies further. For example, you can exclude specific products, categories, or attributes from promotions, providing more flexibility in setting up promotion rules.

To understand the difference between Promotions Standard and Promotions Builder, see [Feature Comparison](/docs/rule-promotions/overview#feature-comparison-promotions-standard-vs-rule-promotions).

As a best practice, we recommend creating new promotions in the Promotions Builder and allowing Promotions Standard to expire. While Promotions Standard can currently run side by side with new ones, transitioning to the Promotions Builder ensures alignment with updated features and facilitates smoother management of promotions over time.

## Stacking and Prioritizing Multiple Promotions

You can create a priority number for both stackable and non-stackable promotions. Simultaneously apply multiple promotions by stacking both cart-level and item-level discounts on top of each other. The priority number assigned to each stackable promotion determines the order in which they are applied. Higher numbers indicate higher priority, meaning those promotions will be applied first.

For example, if you have two promotions that can be stacked, the promotion with priority 90 will be applied before the promotion with priority 60.

If no priority is set, the promotions are applied sequentially based on their creation dates. The newest promotion is applied first and discounted prices calculated against any previously-discounted item prices. For example, if a SKU matches the criteria of the multiple promotions, the promotions will be applied in order from the newest to the oldest. If the original item price is $50 and the newest promotion applies a 10% discount, the item price would be reduced to $45. The next promotion would then be applied to this new price.

:::note

Standard Promotions are always applied first, regardless of any priorities set. Once all Standard Promotions have been applied, promotions configured in Promotions Builder are applied in the order determined by their assigned priority numbers.
