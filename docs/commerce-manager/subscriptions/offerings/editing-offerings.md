Offerings represent a snapshot of their product and plans. If you make updates to a product or plans within an offering, the original product and plans are not updated. Only the product and plans within the offering are updated. Alternatively, you can create a new product and attach it to a new offering.

When you are building an offering:

- you can create new plans and products.
- you can modify an existing product and plans. For example, you can modify the product price or any attributes of a plan included in the offering.

Here's how you build an offering:  

1. Attach your repeat product. An offering can have only one product. See [Repeat Products](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/products/managing-products-cm).
2. Attach your plans. 
    - Plans are the rules that govern your subscription, for example, any discount. 
    - You can combine and reuse plans for as many products as you want, making it quick and easy to create your subscription offerings. 
    - An offering must have at least one plan. See [Plans](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/subscription-plans/managing-subscription-plans-cm).
3. [Create your offerings](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/offerings/managing-subscription-offerings). Offerings are the products and plans that a customer can choose. An offering can consist of many combinations of products or plans, depending on the products and services you offer.
    - When a [customer](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/overview#subscriber-management) chooses a plan, a subscription is created.  
    - Elastic Path Subscriptions manages the billing and recurring payments associated with the subscription. See [Invoicing and Billing](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/billings-payments/overview).
