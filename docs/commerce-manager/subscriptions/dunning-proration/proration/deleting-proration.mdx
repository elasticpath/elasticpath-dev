A proration policy cannot be deleted if it is being used by any subscriptions. This means you must unapply a proration policy that you want to delete from any offerings using that policy before deleting the policy. 

To delete a proration policy:

1. To unapply a proration policy from an offering, go to **Subscriptions** > **Offerings**.
2. From **All Offerings**, select the offering to which you want to unapply a proration policy. 
3. In **Proration Policy** list, either select another proration policy or select **No proration policy**. 
4. Select **Save Offering**.
5. Go to **Subscriptions** > **Dunning and Prorations**.
6. Select **Proration Policies**.
7. Select the proration policy you want to delete. 
8. Select ![trash icon](/assets/trash-icon.png).
9. Select **Delete** to close the **Delete Proration Policy Confirmation** dialog and delete the policy.
