You must not delete a plan if it is associated with an offering as this invalidates the offering. You must detach a plan from an offering before deleting it.

1. Log in to Commerce Manager.
2. Go to **SUBSCRIPTIONS** > **Plans**. The **Subscription Plans** page displays all the plans that you have created.
3. Either:
 
    - Select **...** on the plan that you want to remove, and then select **Delete**.
    - Select the checkbox on any plans that you want to remove and then select **Actions** > **Delete**.

4. Select **Delete** to delete the plan and close the confirmation dialog.
