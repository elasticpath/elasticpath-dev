Once your billing and payment runs have completed, you can view them in **Billing & Payments**. For example, you may want to check the status of the billing and payment runs, or update any existing schedules.

## Managing Billing & Payment Runs

The following steps describe how to manage billing and payment runs.

1. Log in to Commerce Manager.
2. Go to **SUBSCRIPTIONS** > **Billing & Payments**. A list of completed billing and payment runs is displayed. 
    - Select **Schedule ID** to view/update the schedule for a billing or payment run. See [Schedules](/docs/commerce-manager/subscriptions/billings-payments/configuring-runs#schedules).
    - view the current status of your billing and payment runs.
       - **Pending** - Subscriptions has received the request but is currently busy processing other requests.
       - **Started** - Subscriptions has started processing the job.
       - **Complete** - The job has successfully completed.
       - **Failed** - The job has failed. 
    - You can delete one or more of the billing and payment runs by checking the box next to the billing and payment run you want to delete and selecting **Actions** > **Delete**.
    - Troubleshoot any errors the payment or billing run may have received.
