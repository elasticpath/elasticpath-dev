In your organizations, you can manage currencies from **SYSTEM > Organization Settings > Currencies** tab. 

You can set up any currency as your organization's default currency as long as the currency's **Enabled** and **Default** checkboxes are selected while [creating](#create-a-currency) or [editing](#edit-a-currency) a currency.

:::note
- In Commerce Manager, when you create a new currency in your organization, a store belonging to that organization may not immediately inherit that currency. You might have to click the ellipsis associated with the currency **Code**, select **Edit**, and then click **Save** to see the new organization-level currency. See [Edit a Currency](#edit-a-currency).
- In the API, when an organization creates a new currency or if there is a mismatch between the store currencies and organization currencies, pass an empty request body on a store-level currency using the [Update a Currency](/docs/api/pxm/currencies/update-a-currency) endpoint to invalidate the cache. This will ensure that the store currencies are updated with the new organization currency.

## Create a Currency

1. In Commerce Manager, go to **SYSTEM > Organization Settings > Currencies** tab.
1. Click **New Currency**.
1. Enter the following information:

     | Field names           | Description |
     | :-------------------- | :------------- |
     | **Code** | A three-letter currency code. For example: `JPY` for the Japanese Yen. It is recommended that you use the ISO 4217 currency code standard. See [https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217). |
     | **Exchange Rate** | The exchange rate from the default currency. |
     | **Format** |  Specify how the price currency is displayed. For example, `¥{price}` is the format of the Japanese Yen when displayed in text. Depending on localization, a common value for this field might be something like `${price}`, if the currency is to be USD. Canadian French however, uses the symbol as a suffix, so in that case it would be `{price}$`. |
     | **Decimal point** | The decimal point character. For example, `.`. |
     | **Thousands separator** | The thousand separator character. For example, `,`. |
     | **Decimal places** | How many decimal places the currency is formatted to? For example, the US dollar is formatted to two decimal places. |

1. (Optional) Select the **Default** checkbox if you want to set this as the default currency for your organization. 

    :::caution
    - The **Default** checkbox is enabled only if you select the **Enabled** checkbox. 
    - You cannot delete the organization's default currency.
    :::
1. Select the **Enabled** checkbox if you want to enable this currency in your organization.
1. Click **Save**. Once the **Default** checkbox is selected and the currency is saved, you cannot deselect the **Default** checkbox.

## Edit a Currency

1. In Commerce Manager, go to **SYSTEM > Organization Settings > Currencies** tab.
1. Under the **Actions** column, click the ellipsis associated with the currency **Code**.
1. Select **Edit** and modify your changes.
1. Click **Save**.

    :::caution
    You cannot deselect the **Default** checkbox. If you want to change the default currency, you must edit another currency to be the default currency.
    :::


## Delete a Currency

1. In Commerce Manager, go to **SYSTEM > Organization Settings > Currencies** tab.
1. Under the **Actions** column, click the ellipsis associated with the currency **Code**.
