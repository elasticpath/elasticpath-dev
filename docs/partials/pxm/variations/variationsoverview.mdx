Product variations are the product options available for a base product that your shoppers can choose. As a merchandiser, you want to be able to present all the options you have available for your products to make it easier for your shoppers to visualize them and influence a potential sale. Product Variations allow you to create and manage up to 10,000 unique combinations of options for variations of a product. You can then use PXM Catalogs to build different catalogs for different users, giving you greater flexibility with your product data and making it easier for your shoppers to interact with your products.

For example, a product has two variations size and color. The size variation has three options, such as small, medium, and large and the color variation has three options, such as green, red, and blue. This creates a variation matrix with nine possible unique combinations or child products as shown in the following example:

You can create additional variations or options and attach them to a product to increase the number of combinations. Using the previous example, if you add a third variation with three options, you can build child products with 27 unique combinations of variations and options.
