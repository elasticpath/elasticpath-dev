Variations are reusable, and you can attach the same variation to any number of products. You can also create a link between the existing variation and a new product. The following scenario provides an example:

1. Create a variation `shoe size` and add five options in the variation.
1. Create a product `shoe 1` and link the variation `shoe size` to the product.
1. Create second product, `shoe 2` and link the variation `shoe size` to this product as well.
1. Create a third product `shoe 3` and do not link any variation to this product.

`shoe 1` and `shoe 2` inherit the properties of `shoe size` variation, allowing you to build child products with these options. However, you cannot build child products for `shoe 3` unless you assign a variation with at least one option to the product.
