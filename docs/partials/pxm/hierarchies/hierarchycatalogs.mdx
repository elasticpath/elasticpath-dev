The hierarchies determine which products appear in the catalog. When you create a catalog, you specify one or more hierarchies. Only the products that are associated with the selected hierarchies are included in the catalog. Your Front-end developers use the hierarchies to create and populate navigation menus in your storefront. You can improve how your customers search your store using the Catalog View API.

You can also specify the order you want your hierarchies to display in a published catalog. You can order your hierarchies on a catalog-by-catalog basis.
