You can create custom relationships between products in Product Experience Manager, allowing you to link or associate your products in certain ways based on criteria of your choosing. These relationships help improve user experience, boost sales, and enhance product discoverability.

There are some common custom relationship types.

- Cross-selling: Suggesting related products that customers who might want to buy in addition to the product they are viewing. For example, if a customer is looking at laptops, you might suggest memory cards, laptop bags, external mouse, and so on. Cross-selling encourages customers to purchase complementary items.
- Up-selling or alternative products: Suggesting products that serve the same function as the product a customer is viewing, but may be different brands, prices, better specifications, or have additional features. This ensures customers find the best product for their needs and may increase the order value by guiding customers to more premium options.
- Custom collections: Create custom collections of products that share a theme, like **Back to School** or **Summer Holiday Fashion**. These guide customers to multiple products that fit a specific purpose or occasion.
