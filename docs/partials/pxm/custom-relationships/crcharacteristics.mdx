Custom relationships have the following characteristics:

- Custom relationships are bidirectional. For example, if Product A is linked to Product B, then Product B is automatically linked to Product A as well. If a customer views Product A and there's a bidirectional relationship with Product B, Product B will be suggested or related to Product A, and vice versa. This helps in improving product discoverability and ensuring consistent user experiences across your storefront.
- Each relationship that you define must have a unique slug.
- Each relationship slug is prefixed with `CRP_` (custom relationship product). Product Experience Manager adds this automatically if you do not provide it when creating the custom relationship.
- A product can be included in up to 5 relationships.
- Custom relationships can have up to 2000 products.
