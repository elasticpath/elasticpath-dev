With extension templates, you can attach a specific set of custom fields to your products in Product Experience Manager. You can create templates for your products at both the organization and store level.

### Product Templates

Templates are a collection of attributes. Attributes are grouped together to match a particular product type or to provide an input for other purposes, such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or product specification. For example, a *Book* template might contain the attributes, such as *ISBN*, *Author*, *Number of pages*, *Year Published*, or *Condition (New/Used)*.

You can create product templates for both organization and store. However, stores can use organization templates for store level products.

### Product Attributes

Use attributes to define the characteristics of products in a store. For example, you can assign attributes such as, *care instructions* or *fabric*, to a shirt. When a shopper searches for a specific item, attributes help stores to return the products that match the search criteria. For example, when a shopper searches for a large blue shirt, all shirts that are large and blue are returned as the search result.
