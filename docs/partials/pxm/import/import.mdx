You can use Product Import to:

- Add new products. For new products that you want to add, the entry in the .csv file must have an external_ref that does not match any existing products.

- Add new:

    - main image files. See [**Importing Main Image Files**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#using-imported-main-image-files).
    - custom data. See [**Importing custom data**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#importing-custom-data-flows).
    - Make bulk updates to existing products, main image files, and custom data.

- Update existing products, including images, templates/flow fields and entries. The entry in the .csv file must have a unique `id` and/or `external_ref` that matches the `id` and `external_ref` of the existing product you want to update. You may have both a unique `id` and `external_ref`, but you must have at least one.

You cannot use product import to:

- Delete existing products.
- Import product bundles.

Product Import uses a [**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#characteristics-of-csv-import-files) file to import/update products, main image files, and custom extension data.

When you send a product import request, a job is created. Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send product import requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed. See [**Jobs**](/docs/api/pxm/products/jobs) API or [Jobs](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/jobs/) in Commerce Manager.

We recommend that you include the maximum allowed number of products in each `csv`file (for example, up to 50,000 rows or a file size of 50 megabytes, see [**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#characteristics-of-csv-import-files)) to minimize the number of files you submit. This helps prevent extended waiting times for processing jobs.
