Several Product Experience Manager endpoints function as jobs. When any of these endpoints are run, a job is automatically created.

- product [**import**](/docs/api/pxm/products/import-products).
- product [**export**](/docs/api/pxm/products/export-products).
- price book [import](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/import-a-price-book-and-prices).
- [**duplicating hierarchies**](/docs/api/pxm/products/duplicate-hierarchy).
- [**building child products**](/docs/api/pxm/products/build-child-products).

#### Characteristics of Jobs

Jobs have the following characteristics.

- Jobs are asynchronous.
- Jobs have a different status, depending on where a job is in its lifecycle. See [**Job Lifecycle**](#job-lifecycle).
- Jobs include the data used when an endpoint is run.
- Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send requests using endpoints that function as jobs, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed.
- Jobs report messages and/or errors to help you understand:

- what changes a job implemented in Commerce.
- the reasons for any failed jobs.

#### Job Lifecycle

A job has the following lifecycle.

![job lifecycle](/assets/job-lifecycle.png)

- **PENDING** - Commerce has received the request but is currently busy processing other requests.
- **STARTED** - Commerce has started processing the job.
- **SUCCESS** - The job has successfully completed.
- **FAILED** - The job has failed. See [**Get job errors**](/docs/api/pxm/products/get-all-jobs).
