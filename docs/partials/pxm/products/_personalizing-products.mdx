You can allow your shoppers to add custom text to a product when adding product items to their carts. This is useful, for example, if you have a product like a T-shirt that can be personalized or you sell greetings cards that can be printed with your shoppers personalized messages. You can do this by configuring the the `custom_inputs` attribute. See [**Create a product**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
