Commerce automatically assigns types to the products you create. In Commerce Manager, you can see at a glance the product types in a list of a products. In addition, you can filter on product types in both the API and Commerce Manager.

Product types can also be used in catalogs. For example, in your catalog, you can filter on `parent` so that only your parent products are displayed in your storefront.

Products have one of the following types:

* `standard` - Standard products are a standalone products.
* `parent` - A parent product is a product that has child products that have been built using the [**Build Child Products**](/docs/api/pxm/products/build-child-products) endpoint.
* `child` -  When you configure product variations and variation options for parent products, the child products derived from the parent products are automatically created in Commerce.
* `bundle` - A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising one or more standalone products (in other words, `components`) to be sold together. See [**Bundle Components and Options**](#bundle-components-and-options).

:::note
In Commerce Manager, `standard` products are called **Product**.
