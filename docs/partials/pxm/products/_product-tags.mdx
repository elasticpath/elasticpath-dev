You can use product tags to store or assign a key word against a product or service that you sell in your store. The product tag can then be used to describe or label that product. Product tags represent similarities between products who do not share the same attributes. Using product tags means that you can group your products together, for example, by brand, category, subcategory, colors, types, industries, and so on.

A typical use case for product tags is to categorize your products based on color. For example, you could tag the products that you sell in your storefront with a color. Your shoppers can then search your products by color, enabling shoppers to quickly find what they are looking for, increasing the likelihood of a purchase, and boosting conversion rates.
