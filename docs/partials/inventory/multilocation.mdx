Inventories allows you to optionally manage stock across multiple locations, giving you better control over your inventory and improving stock accuracy.

By offering localized stock information and flexible order fulfilment options, you can enhance your customer's shopping experience. For example, you can use multi-location inventory to support the **Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store** process. Tagging inventory with specific locations, allows you to select a designated location for dispatch when adding stock to a product, ensuring that inventory is accurately tracked and readily available for in-store pickup orders. Multi-location inventory optimizes your fulfillment process by aligning stock with the most appropriate physical locations, improving efficiency and boosting customer satisfaction.

An inventory location is a specific physical or virtual place where stock or inventory is stored, tracked, and managed. Your inventory locations could refer to a warehouse, retail store, or distribution center. You may want a virtual inventory location, for example, for promotions. You may want to collect all the products in a promotion virtually in one place within your system, to ensure that promotional stock is reserved and accurately tracked.

When creating an inventory location, there are several details you need to consider including name, description, and GPS location. In addition, you can specify an `external_ref` which is a unique attribute that you could use to contain information from an external warehouse system, for example.

You can create individual inventory locations, either for a single physical site or for multiple distinct locations.

In addition, you can import your locations from another company system. See Importing locations.
