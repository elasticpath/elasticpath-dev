An inventory location is a specific physical or virtual place where stock or inventory is stored, tracked, and managed. Your inventory locations could refer to a warehouse, retail store, distribution center, or even specific sections within these places, like shelves, bins, or racks. You may want a virtual inventory location, for example, for promotions. You may want to collect all the products in the promotion virtually in one place within your system, to ensure that promotional stock is reserved and accurately tracked.

In the Inventories API, you can create an inventory location. You can create individual inventory locations, either for a single physical site or for multiple distinct locations.

When creating an inventory location, there are several details, you need to consider.

- The locations details, including name, description, and GPS location.
- Setting the stock for your locations.
