The Inventory API allows you to optionally manage stock across multiple locations, giving you better control over your inventory and improving stock accuracy. By offering localized stock information and flexible order fulfilment options, you can enhance your customer's shopping experience.

For example, you can use multi-location inventory to support the "Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store" process. Tagging inventory with specific locations, allows you to select a designated location for dispatch when adding stock to a product, ensuring that inventory is accurately tracked and readily available for in-store pickup orders. Multi-location inventory optimizes your fulfillment process by aligning stock with the most appropriate physical locations, improving efficiency and boosting customer satisfaction.
