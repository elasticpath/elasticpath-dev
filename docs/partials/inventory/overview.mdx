Using Inventories allows you to track stock inventory for products in Elastic Path Composable Commerce at both organization and store level.

Inventory is the quantity of each product that you have in stock. The inventory service allows you and your business to track inventory, with a transactional historic log, and optionally, manage stock across multiple locations.

You can manage inventory using both:

- the [Inventories API](/docs/api/pxm/inventory)
- [Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/Products/manage-product-inventory).

### What is Inventory?

Inventory for each product is tracked using the following values:

- **Total**: The amount of product in stock. This can be expressed by the following equation: Total = Available + Allocated
- **Available**: The amount of product available in stock minus allocated products. This can be expressed by the following equation: Available = Total - Allocated.
- **Allocated**: The amount of reserved product in stock.
- **Location**: The location of the stock. For each location, this can be expressed by the following equation: Total = Available + Allocated. One or more locations contributes to an aggregated stock total.
