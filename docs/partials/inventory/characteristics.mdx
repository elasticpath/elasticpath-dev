Inventories has the following characteristics:

- It is possible for more products to be in carts than there are in stock if the add to cart request quantity is less than available stocks. For example, when available stocks are 100, a user can add 60 to cart 1 and then 50 to cart 1, or user A can add 80 to cart 1, while user B can add 30 to cart 2.
- It is possible for more products to be checked out than there are in stock if the add to cart request quantity is less than the available stocks.
- It is not possible for more stock to be paid for than is in stock.
- It is a race for your customers to pay for an order, and whoever does not pay fast enough, is left disappointed.
