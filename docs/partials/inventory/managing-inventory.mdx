Managing inventory involves a variety of tasks aimed at ensuring that stock levels are optimized, products are stored correctly, and supply meets demand, efficiently.

Using Inventories, you can:

- identify the source of a stock position.
- explicitly set stock for your locations.
- change stock.
- move stock between locations automatically. Stock positions can be updated in near real-time using batch updates.
- see if there are failures when updating stock positions.
- disable or enable locations.
