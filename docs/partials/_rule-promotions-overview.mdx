The Rule Promotions provide the flexibility to offer diverse discounts to shoppers. They support discounts of varying complexities, from code-based customer discounts, to Buy X Get Y scenarios, fixed price promotions, and more based on your business needs.

You can create a Rule Promotion using the [Rule Promotions API](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/rule-promotions-api-overview) or [Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder). 

To apply Rule Promotions API in carts and orders, ensure that you have enabled the `use_rule_promotions` field in [Cart Settings](/docs/carts-orders/carts/cart-management/cart-settings/update-cart-settings). You can also update a specific cart to use Rule Promotions. See [Update a Cart](/docs/carts-orders/carts/cart-management/update-a-cart). This turns on hybrid mode, which means you can simultaneously use both [Promotions Standard](/docs/promotions/promotion-management/promotion-management-overview) and Rule Promotions. For example, let's consider the following scenario:

If the cart has:
- A Promotion Standard offering a 10% discount on the shopping cart
- A Rule Promotion offering a 20% discount on the shopping cart

Shoppers qualify for both discounts, prompting the system to apply both types of discount to your shopping cart. This means you get a 10% discount from the Promotions Standard and a 20% discount from the Rule Promotion. The Promotions Standard discount is always applied before the Rule Promotion discount, regardless of their creation dates. After applying the Promotions Standard discount, the Rule Promotion discount is then applied based on its creation date, with the newest promotion applied first and the oldest promotion stacked on top of the newest promotion.

:::note

- Cart-level discounts that are checked out will appear on orders with the same type as they do in carts, labeled as `promotion_item`. For backward compatibility, this change is specific to Rule Promotions only.
- When managing promotions and discounts, multiple types of discounts use the same promotion code. The system breaks down these discounts in the cart itemâ€™s metadata. This breakdown is detailed in the `discounts.constituents` object, showing which part of the discount comes from which specific promotion, identified by their promotion ID. When you use the [Get Cart Items](/docs/api/carts/get-cart-items) endpoint, the response example shows the breakdown of the same promotion code used in both Promotions Standard and Rule Promotions.

## Rule Set

A rule set is essentially a set of criteria that determine when and how a promotion should be applied. It consists of conditions and corresponding actions. It can also contain targeted catalogs and currencies. 

### Conditions

Conditions describe the criteria necessary for discount eligibility. For example, *Buy X get Y 50% off*. This condition requires the shopper to buy one item to receive 50% discount on another item. For more information, see [Rule Promotions API overview](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/rule-promotions-api-overview).

### Actions

Actions describe how discounts are applied to eligible carts and orders. These signify the discount type, level, configuration, and any limitations or restrictions when applying.

You can create actions to specify:

- Action conditions: Specifying which items should be included or excluded when applying the discounts. This can be based on factors such as item SKUs, product attributes, quantities, categories. For more information, see [Create a Condition Rule Promotion](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/item-rule-promotions/create-condition-rule-promotion).
- Action limitations: Imposing restrictions or limitations on the number of products eligible for discounts, maximum discount amounts, and total applications for discounts. For more information, see [Action Limitations](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/action-limitations/action-limitations-overview).

### Sub Conditions

Sub conditions offer further refinement within rules and actions, specifying additional criteria that must be met for the promotion or discount to be applied. These can include conditions such as minimum quantities for specific item SKUs, exclusion of certain items, or additional constraints for eligibility. For more information, see [Create a Cart Percent Discount with Sub Conditions](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/cart-rule-promotions/create-a-cart-percent-discount-with-subconditions) and [Create an Item Rule Promotion with Sub Conditions](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/item-rule-promotions/create-an-item-rule-promotion-with-sub-conditions).

### Strategies

Strategies describe the type of condition or action.

For instance:
- Rule strategies define the types of conditions that need to be met for eligibility. These might include cart total amount, item prices, cart custom attributes, and more. 
- Action strategies refer to the type of action execution run when the eligibility criteria are met. For actions, the possible strategies are `cart_discount` and `item_discount`. For more information, see [Rule Promotions API Overview](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotions-api/rule-promotions-api-overview).

### Catalogs and Currencies

You can specify which catalogs and currencies the rules apply to. When catalogs are defined in a promotion, the promotion cannot apply to custom items. When no catalogs are defined, the promotion can apply to any item type, including custom items. 

You can choose to apply discounts to carts in a specific currency. If no currencies are defined, the discount applies to carts in any currency.

You can only set one currency for each rule promotion.
