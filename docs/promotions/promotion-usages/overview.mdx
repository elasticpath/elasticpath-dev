Promotion usages are helpful in tracking and understanding how promotional offers are utilized. This includes details such as which promotions were used, how frequently they were used, order ID, code ID, customer email, date of the promotion's usage. To retrieve the usage history of a specific promotion, see [Get Promotion Usages](/docs/api/promotions/get-promotion-codes).

You can also track the history of a specific promotion code within a particular promotion. See [Get a Promotion Code Usage](/docs/promotions/promotion-usages/get-a-promotion-code-usage).

Additionally, you can also choose to anonymize customer email addresses associated with promotion usages. For more information, see [Anonymize Usages](/docs/promotions/promotion-usages/anonymize-usages).
