### Editing catalog releases

A catalog release provides a snapshot of product information taken at the time of publication. Depending on how many times you have published the catalog, the latest release and the two releases prior to the latest release are available. This is useful if you want to go back to an earlier version of a catalog or see the changes that have been made between releases. In addition, you can edit your:

- Catalog release details.
- Existing products details or add a new product if it is associated with a hierarchy displayed in the catalog.
- Existing hierarchy's details. 

If you make changes to a catalog release, you must republish the catalog for the changes to appear in the store front. 

You can go back to an earlier release of a catalog by [deleting](#deleting-catalog-releases) the latest release.
