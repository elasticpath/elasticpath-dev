You can manage files on the **Files** page.

This page shows all files associated with your store, including image files for products. The list displays the name, ID, date created, file size, and MIME-type of each file.

The supported upload file type formats are:

- .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .mov
- .mpg .mp4, .mp3, .aac
- .vrml, .vr
- .doc(x), ppt(x), xls(x), pdf

By default, the maximum file size is 8 Megabytes. If you need to support larger file sizes, contact your Elastic Path representative.

Delete files by selecting the Trash can icon next to the listing.

To change the file or files associated with a product, see [Create Product-File Relationships](/docs/pxm/products/product-asset-relationships/file-relationship/create-product-file-relationships).
