## What is the Facebook Pixel?

The Facebook Pixel is a script that enables Facebook to track user activities on your site. Specifically, it's used to
identify a ROI for your Facebook and Instagram ad-spend.

## Adding your Facebook Pixel to your Studio Account

1. Open up the **Integrations** section in Studio.
2. Once here, select the **(+)** to the right of Facebook Pixel.
3. Here you'll be prompted to add your Pixel ID. This ID can be found in your Facebook Events Manager.

   [More about that here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/898185560232180?id=1205376682832142).
