## Templates

When integrating with Klevu, there are two types of search components you can use:

- The Klevu search templates. This means the UI and styling is automatically generated by Klevu.
- The Studio **Search** component that uses Studio styling and HTML. We recommend you start with this as it matches the styling of your Studio site.
