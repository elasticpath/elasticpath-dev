You can quickly and easily integrate Studio with Klevu. Klevu is an advanced AI-driven search and product discovery platform specifically designed for e-commerce websites. Once configured, using Studio's built-in Klevu integration, you can:

- build a search page in Studio, enabling you to leverage the Klevu search engine in your Studio storefronts.
- build a page in Studio that uses a **Klevu recommendations** component to leverage Klevu Recommendations, designed to enhance your shoppers experience by providing personalized product suggestions.

## Klevu Events

Reporting user interaction with Klevu is crucial to allow the machine learning algorithms to accurately rank items. By reporting user interactions, such as clicks, searches, and purchases, Klevu's algorithms can better understand which products are most relevant to users.

The Klevu integration is using two Klevu events, searches and clicks. Anytime a shopper searches using the Studio search page and/or clicks on a product, you can see this in the Klevu dashboard.
