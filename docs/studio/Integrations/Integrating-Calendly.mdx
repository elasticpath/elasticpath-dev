## Overview

Calendly is a hub for scheduling meetings professionally and efficiently, eliminating the hassle of back-and-forth
emails so you can get back to work.

## Connecting Calendly

Unlike our other integrations, Calendly can currently only be embedded by getting an embed code and pasting it into a
custom section in Studio. Please view
our [help doc on custom sections here](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page).

## Finding your Calendly code

1. On your Calendly dashboard, visit the Event Types tab on your Home page.
2. Select the gear icon and select Add to Website.
3. Choose the type of embed that you'd like, and copy the link.
