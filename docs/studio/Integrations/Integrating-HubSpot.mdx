## Quick Notes

+ You are not able to add users who submit an Studio form to an active list.
+ When a visitor fills out a form, if that form is properly configured to *push to a HubSpot list* (more on this below),
  we'll add them to the selected list and send their data to HubSpot.
+ You can easily select a HubSpot form to embed directly into an Studio CTA. This will record the submission both in
  Studio and HubSpot, most preferable when you need custom form fields to be submitted to HubSpot.

**Connecting HubSpot to Studio**

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Click the (+) icon to the right of the HubSpot integration.
