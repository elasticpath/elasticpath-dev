When using Typeform there are several different ways to embed your form on your Studio site. Below is a comprehensive
guide on how to use each of these options:

1. First, you'll need to create your Typeform. Once created (and published) click *Share* in the form editor. This will
   bring you to a page that lists the various embed options available to you. When clicking these options, you'll see a
   button that reads "Get Code"; click this button to copy the specific embed code for your form.

2. Below are guides for each of Typeforms embed
   options. [Here is a link to Typeforms official documentation](https://www.typeform.com/help/a/embed-your-typeform-360029249212/)
   if you're having trouble understanding any of these options.

- **Standard**: Use this option to embed your Typeform on a page you created through Studio. Once you have the embed code, see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page) to add it to a specific place on a single page.

- **Full Page**: This option is not currently supported through Studio. However, the same result is achieved if you create a
  *landing page*, add the code to the page, see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page), and then disable the header/footer for that landing page.

- **Popup**: Use this option to create an embeddable-button that opens your form as a popup when clicked. Once you have the embed code, see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page) to add it to a specific place on a single page.

- **Slider**: Your full-size typeform slides in from the side. Once you have the embed code,
  see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page) to add it to a specific place on a single page.

- **Popover**: Open as a floating popover when someone hits the button. Once you have the embed code,
  see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page) to add it to a specific place on a single page ***or*** see [Adding HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to All Pages
  ](/docs/studio/Integrations/Adding-HTML-CSS-or-JavaScript-to-all-your-pages) if you want to
  add it to all pages.

- **Side tab**: Open as a floating panel when someone hits the button. Once you have the embed code,
  see [Embedding custom code in a Page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page) to add it to a specific place on a
  single page ***or*** see [Adding HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to All Pages
  ](/docs/studio/Integrations/Adding-HTML-CSS-or-JavaScript-to-all-your-pages) if you want to
  add it to all pages.

- **Embed SDK**: This is not currently supported by Studio.
