## Keep in mind

If you've previously installed Studio and are installing it again, re-adding the Studio App to your Shopify store will
not restore any previously configured pages if it's re-added more than **2 days** after the last uninstall.

1. Create a Shopify Account and ensure you have at least one active product.
2. Add the Studio App in Shopify, this creates an Studio sales channel which asks for several different *read-only*
   permissions. ([Link to our app listing!](https://apps.shopify.com/unstack))
3. Approving the permission requests will create an Studio account and then will bring you back to Shopify where you
   are prompted to confirm billing details.
4. Once the billing details have been confirmed, you'll be redirected back to Studio where you can start building out
   your first landing page!
