Have a **Typekit** account and want to pull in some fonts that aren't currently available in your account? This is the
article for you.

The first step is to log into your Studio account, open ***Integrations*** and scroll down to ***Typekit*** under
***Libraries.*** Click the (+) sign and enter your **Kit ID.**

## Don't already have a **Kit ID**? Here is how to make one.

1. In Typekit, identify the font(s) you'd like to use
2. Select "Use Font" which should show you a modal
3. In the modal select the "Web" tab and click ***create new kit***
4. On the next screen, add the domains where you'd like to use this font and create the kit!

Now that your Kit ID has been added properly, it's time to add the fonts to your account. To do this, navigate to **Design** > **Style Guide**, scroll down to ***Fonts*** and click **+New Font**.

Clicking this "New Font" button slides in the drawer (pictured below) and allows you to select from the fonts available
to your account though both Google Fonts and the *Kit ID* you connected above.
