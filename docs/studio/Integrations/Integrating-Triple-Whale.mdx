When you use Studio's native Triple Whale integration you're enabling both the standard Triple Pixel, as well as
add-to-cart tracking for all of your pages. The below steps take you through exactly how to configure this integration.

1. Open your Studio account, and navigate to ***Settings*** > ***Integrations***.
2. From that page, you'll find Triple Whale in the **Tracking and Analytics** section.
3. Click the (+) to the right of the Triple Whale integration.

4. Enter the **myshopify** URL for your Shopify store. **Do not** enter the domain your store is hosted on otherwise the
   integration will not work properly.
