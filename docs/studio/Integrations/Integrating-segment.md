You can quickly and easily integrate Studio with Segment. Once configured, you can use Studio's built-in Segment component to leverage Segments powerful customer data platform in your storefront.

Segment is a customer data platform that simplifies the process of collecting data and connecting to new tools. With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive your Studio data, and send the data to your marketing, product, and analytics tools, including data warehouses.

You can sync your Commerce data with the Commerce Segment integration. This allows all customer and order changes to be synced with Studio, ensuring that when customers view product details pages or when products are added to carts in your Studio storefront, Segment first processes the data, then translates and routes it to the destinations you have enabled in Segment. This information enables you to personalize the shopper experience that you are offering to your shoppers.

## Building Customer Profiles Using Segment Unify

You can use Segment Unify to build a complete view of your customers. With identity resolution, you can track every interaction across an entire user journey in Studio, to create unified, real-time customer identities. You can then use these profiles to provide personalized experiences for your shoppers, using computer traits and predictive analytics. For example, you can provide a special offer to VIP customers. See [Using the Segment Integration](#using-the-segment-integration).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following before configuring the Segment integration.

1. Ensure that you are integrated with Commerce. See [Getting Started with Composable Commerce](/docs/studio/getting-started-with-epcc).
2. A Studio storefront.
3. A Segment account with your **Elastic Path Studio Source** configured. See [Elastic Path Studio Source](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/elastic-path-cx-studio/).

## Best Practices

Follow these steps to integrate with Segment.

    |--------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Source ID          | Required | A Segment source ID that allows you to push data to your Segment account.                                                                                 |

## Using the Segment Integration

You can use your Segment integration to build customer profiles based on their interactions in your Studio storefront.

### Using Segment Computed Traits

The following example describes using a Segment computer trait to provide a special offer to a new customer.

1. Select **Content** > **Landing Pages**.
2. Select the landing page where you want to configure your computer trait. For example, you might want to configure this on your product detail page, product detail page templates or any of your site pages.
3. To enable conditional content on your section, select the **{...}** icon from the section toolbar.
4. Select **Condition** and select **Trait** from the drop-down list.

   ![segment trait](/assets/segment_trait.png)
5. You must have created a computed trait in Unify. Then, in Studio, input a value that corresponds to  a computed trait in Unify. The value you input in Studio must reference the trait key and not the trait name. For example, for the **LTV** computed trait in Segment:

   ![segment computed trait](/assets/segment_computed_trait.png)

   Configure the parameter in Studio as follows:

   | Parameter     | Value                     |
   |---------------|---------------------------|
   | **Parameter** | **ltv**                   |
   | **Operator**  | **greater than or equal** |
   | **Value**     | **25**                    |
6. Add a text box.
7. Add your text, depending on your requirements.

   ![segment trait text](/assets/segment_text.png)
8. Save and publish your changes.
9. When a shopper logs into the storefront and starts viewing products, you can see in your source in Segment, a new event stream that has all the activity for this user.

   Once the shopper meets the condition, the storefront automatically offers them the promotion.

### Using Segment Audience Personalization

The following example describes personalizing content for an **Audience** in Segment. For example, you may want to offer a promotion to VIP Customers.

1. Select **Content** > **Landing Pages**.
2. Select the landing page where you want to configure your audience. For example, you might want to configure this on your product detail page, product detail page templates, or any of your site pages.
3. To enable conditional content on your section, select the **{...}** icon from the section toolbar.
4. Select **Condition** and select **Audience** from the drop-down list.

   ![segment computed trait](/assets/segment_audience.png)

   You must have defined an audience in Unify, for example, **VIP Customers**. Then, in Studio, input a value that corresponds to your audience in Unify. The value you input in Studio must reference the audience key. For example, for the **VIP Customers** audience in Segment, configure the parameter in Studio as follows:

   | Parameter            | Value             |
      |----------------------|-------------------|
   | **Operator**         | **equals**        |
   | **Value**            | **vip-customers** |

   :::note
   To personalize content for more than one audience, you can use advanced comparison. For example, if you have several audiences beginning with **vip**, you can target them all using the **starts with** operator.
   :::

   Once the shopper meets the condition, the storefront automatically offers them the promotion.

## Viewing Studio Event Streams in Segment

Event streams sources collect data from Studio to monitor shoppers actions in your Studio storefronts.

1. If you go to **Unify** > **Profile Explorer**, you can see the profile for the shopper.

   ![unify customer profile](/assets/unify_profile.png)
2. In addition, if you select a user, you can view the `user_id` for the shopper. This is also the Composable Commerce account number.
