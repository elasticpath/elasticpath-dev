## Overview

reCAPTCHA is a tool by Google that is probably your strongest ally in the fight against spam form submissions. It does
this by analyzing the user's behavior to confirm that they're human. If it is unable to do so, it will give the user a
test that a normal bot would have a hard time completing.

## How do I set up reCAPTCHA?

1. In Studio, open your *Integrations* page which is found under *Settings* on the left-hand side of the admin panel.
2. On the *Integrations* page, scroll down to "Forms, Email & CRM". Directly under that section you'll see an item
   called ***reCAPTCHA.*** Click on the ( + ) to get started.
3. Once you click on the (+) symbol to the right, a drawer will appear asking you to define a "Version" and to input
   both a *Site Key* and *Secret Key.*

4. To obtain a *Site Key* and a *Secret Key* you'll need to jump
   into [Google's reCAPTCHA signup flow](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) and input the information that
   they require.

   :::note
   Studio offers support for two versions; **V2** and **V3**. And while there
   are [many differences between them](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions), the main difference is
   that **V3** doesn't require the standard click on "I'm not a robot" that reCAPTCHA has become so well known for.

5. With both your **Site Key** and **Secret Key** jump back into Studio and drop those values into the corresponding
   fields.

   If you've selected **reCAPTCHA V3**, you'll need to also set a *threshold* before you can save the configuration.
   This *threshold* is directly tied to the "score" that Google uses to determine if the user is legitimate. Studio defaults
   this to **0.7**, but you're more than welcome to set this to whatever you think it should be. We highly recommend
   reading up on this [via Google's official documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3#interpreting_the_score) before you make a decision.

6. Once satisfied, save the configuration. You've now set up reCAPTCHA on your site! ðŸŽ‰
