Following this guide will apply the code to **every page and article** on your site. If you're looking to only apply it
to one page, please
follow [this guide on adding code to a page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/embedding-custom-code-in-a-page).

## Adding a Custom Integration

First, you'll need to open the ***Integrations*** option within Studio. Once open, scroll all the way to the bottom
where you'll see a button that reads "Add Integration".

From here, there are three more settings to configure:

1. ***Integration Name***; this is only used internally to identify what the custom integration is so name it something
   that will help you (or others) identify it later.
2. ***Page Placement***; this lets you define where on your pages you'd like it to load. There are three possible
   options here:

    - Header: Between the <head> </head> tags
    - Top of Body: Directly after the ```<body>``` tag
    - Bottom of Body: Directly before the ```</body>``` tag

3. ***Script***; the actual tag or script that you're trying to fire off across the site.

Once you're finished, don't forget to hit "Save Integration" to save your work and apply the script to your account!
