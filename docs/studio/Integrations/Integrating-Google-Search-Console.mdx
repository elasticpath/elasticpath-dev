To connect Google Search Console to Studio you'll first need to head to **Settings > Integrations** in the Studio
admin, and find *Google Search Console* from the list of our integrations. Click the **(+)** to the right of the
integration and follow the prompts in the window that opens.

Once the prompts are completed, *Google Search Console* should now be integrated with your account meaning that you can
now access your SEO data from the **SEO** option found under **Insights**.
