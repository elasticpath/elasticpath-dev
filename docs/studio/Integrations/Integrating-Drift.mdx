## How do we connect to Drift?

Drift connects to Studio solely through their javascript integration. When added, the Drift widget code will be added
to **all** pages and articles on your site. If you'd like to prevent it from showing up on certain pages please
reference [this article from Drift](https://gethelp.drift.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019348894-How-to-Set-Up-and-Manage-The-Display-Settings-of-Your-Widget#h_01ET1N8BNC07D3BYR0V34ACY83).

## Adding the code:

1. Go into Drift's **[Widget Settings page](https://app.drift.com/settings2/widget)** in-app.
2. Click the **install accordion** to view your widget installation options.

5. Copy this alphanumeric App ID sandwiched between "drift.load('" and "');" which will **not** contain a single
   quote ('), double quote ("), parentheses, and will not contain the drift.load.
6. Then, head to the**integrations page** in Studio and click the (+) icon to the right of Drift. This is where you and
   paste this App ID.
