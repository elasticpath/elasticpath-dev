Layouts are a powerful tool that offers flexibility in designing the structure of your pages. Layouts allow you to create visually appealing and well-structured pages efficiently, ensuring consistency and ease of use across your site.

You can either create new components and add them to a layout component, or you can design a new layout in the layout editor and add the sections you want using the page editor. When working in the page editor, you can combine newly-created components with existing components for a customized layout.

The following steps describe how to:

- Create a new layout component that adds a right-hand sidebar to the main content called right-hand sidebar.
- Creates a new layout called product promotion that:
    - uses the right-hand sidebar layout.
    - adds a minimal header and footer to the new layout
    - customizes the minimal header and footer
-  creates a new page that uses the new layout.

## Step 1 - Create a New Layout Component

To add a new layout component:

1. Go to **Design**.
1. Select **Sections**.
1. Select +New Section.
1. Complete the details as follows:

    | Option | Description |

    | Name | Provide a descriptive name for your layout. |
    | Slug | Provide a unique slug for your layout. |
    | Category | From the list, select **Layout**. |

1. Configure your HTMl and CSS.
