To access the Layouts Editor:

1. From Studio, select **Design**.
1. Select **Layouts**.
1. Select **+ Add layout**. The **New layout** panel is displayed.
1. Specify a name for your layout. This should be something easy to understand, indicating the layout's purpose or function. For example, **Featured products** or **Sales countdown**.
1. In **Layout component**, select a layout component from the list. You can either choose:

    - **Single Column Layout** - Content is stacked in a vertical column. This layout is useful for narrow screens sizes, so its commonly used in mobile design or responsive web layouts.
    - A custom layout component that you have created. See [Layouts](/docs/studio/developers/components/layout).
1. Select **Create layout**.
1. When you create a new page, your new page automatically uses the new layout.
