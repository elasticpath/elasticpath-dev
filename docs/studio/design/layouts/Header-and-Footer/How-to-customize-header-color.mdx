Adjusting your background color for the header is done in one of two ways.

1. Set in the **elements** page.
2. Set page-by-page for landing pages or hero sections

Then, simply select "Publish" when it appears after the change.

To keep things simple we have our headers auto-adjust to the hero section's background color.
