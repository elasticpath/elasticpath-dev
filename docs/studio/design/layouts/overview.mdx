You can use the Layout editor to design the structure of your pages. Layouts determine how information, visuals, and interactive components are organized to guide visitors through the content toward specific goals, such as making a purchase or signing up for an offer.

With the Layout editor, you can create template layouts that you then apply to your Studio pages, streamlining the process of developing your Studio pages, saving time and improving the user experience of your pages.

When you navigate to **Layouts**, you can see a list of all your current layouts and the number of pages using each one.

In addition, you can see what layouts are being used on your default pages, and you can change them if you wish.
