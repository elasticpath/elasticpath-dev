You can use the Layout editor to design the structure of your pages. Layouts determine how information, visuals, and interactive components are organized to guide visitors through the content toward specific goals, such as making a purchase or signing up for an offer.

- You create layouts using the Layout component.
- With the Layout editor, you can manage your layouts. You can see a list of all your current layouts and the number of pages using each one. In addition, you can see the layouts used on your default pages, and change them if you wish.
- You apply your layouts to your pages.

Layouts streamline the process of developing your Studio pages, saving time and improving your users experience of your pages.
