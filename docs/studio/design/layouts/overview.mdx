You can use layouts to design the structure of your pages. Layouts determine how information, visuals, and interactive components are organized to guide visitors through the content toward specific goals, such as making a purchase or signing up for an offer. Layouts streamline the process of developing your Studio pages, saving time and improving your users experience of your pages.

Below is an overview of the steps to follow to use layouts:

1. Create your custom components, including banners, headers, footers, or sections. See [Custom Components](/docs/studio/developers/components).
1. In the Layout editor, create your new layout and add the custom components you want to use in the layout.
1. Once you save and publish your layout, when you create a new page, the new page will use the new layout.
1. You can see a list of all your current layouts and the number of pages using each one. In addition, you can see the layouts used on your default pages, and change them if you wish.

## Default Layouts

There are two default layouts.

| Default Layout | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Full header - Full Footer |  |
| Minimal header - Minimal footer | |
