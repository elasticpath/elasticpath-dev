## Colors

Colors control your entire site's colors in the 7 different areas;

* Brand primary
* Success
* Warning
* Dark background
* Light background
* Dark text
* Light text

Success and warning can be green-ish and orange-ish colors, or anything you'd like. As for the rest, we suggest an
online app like [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) for generating it.

**What colors do we accept?**

We accept HEX and RGB color codes.

## Fonts

You can select up to 4 fonts to be used across your site.

## Header

![Formatting Header](/assets/studio/d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.netdocsassets5e4848762c7d3a7e9ae7ce2dimages5ed95bc004286306f804ae42file-a442WogaXh.png)

Within the header you can adjust the look of links, action, and hover which have been covered previously.

Main change here to call out, is how to adjust the look of the action link/button which may be done under action.

![Formatting Elements in Header](/assets/studio/d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.netdocsassets5e4848762c7d3a7e9ae7ce2dimages5ed95c0104286306f804ae47file-rRiKpmmZV9.png)

You can use that dropdown to toggle between primary, secondary, and action link.
