When a Shopify purchase is made through an Studio page, the transaction is ultimately handled through the standard
Shopify checkout process. Therefore, for conversions to be counted in 3rd party platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads,
Google Analytics, LinkedIn, or Bing Ads, tracking needs to be configured from within Shopify.

If setting this up is unfamiliar territory for you, we recommend that you start this process by following [Shopify's official documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/status-tracking/customize-order-status/add-conversion-tracking).
