## Where are my products?

When using our Shopify integration, it's imperative that any products you've created in Shopify are in-sync with
Studio. Therefore, there are two ways you can sync data between the two:

1. Let the auto-sync take care of things

   Every day, an auto-sync job kicks off to pull in the latest data from Shopify. Therefore if you've made changes to a
   product, or added a product in Shopify, all you need to do is wait for the next sync job to kick off.

2. Start a manual sync

   If you need the product changes in Studio as soon as you make them, then you can manually sync your product changes
   to
   Studio via the **Sync Now** button found under **Integrations** > **Shopify** > **Edit**.

   This is also where you'll be able to see the last time a Shopify > Studio sync was performed.

## Still not seeing your products in Studio?

If you've already re-sync'd your account, and you're still not seeing your
products, [check to make sure they are marked as available for the Studio Sales Channel in Shopify](/docs/studio/Shopify/How-do-I-enable-a-product-for-a-sales-channel-in-Shopify).
