## Adding custom scripts to your order confirmation page

As these pages are being handled by Shopify, scripts and tracking codes will need to be added via Shopify, not
Studio. See [Conversion Tracking for Shopify Purchases](/docs/studio/Shopify/Conversion-Tracking-for-Shopify-Purchases).

When using Studio with Shopify almost all of your store is managed through Studio. However, there are a couple parts
that are not managed through Studio; specifically the checkout process and the order confirmation page in particular.

These are completely handled by Shopify, and changes to them need to be made through Shopify.
