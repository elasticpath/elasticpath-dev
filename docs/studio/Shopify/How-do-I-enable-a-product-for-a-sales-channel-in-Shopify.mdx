## Make products available to your sales channels

You can control where you are selling a product by making it available to your active sales channels. If you decide not
to make a product available to a particular sales channel, then it will be hidden from that channel's product catalog.
You might hide a product from a sales channel for a variety of reasons:

* You have seasonal products that you want to display for only part of the year.
* A product is out of stock but you will have more in stock at a later date.
* You don't want to sell a product, but you might offer it again later.
* You want to offer online exclusive, or in-store exclusive products.
* You don't want to sell a product using a particular sales channel.
