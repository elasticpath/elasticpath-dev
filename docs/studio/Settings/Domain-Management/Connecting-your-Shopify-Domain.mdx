## Subscription Note

If you're not on a paying plan you will not see the CNAME record for adding an SSL or the A record for redirecting the
root domain. Due to this, you'll only see one DNS record.

:::caution
Removing/deleting any records that have been previously configured can have **serious**, unintended consequences. If for
whatever reason you're uncomfortable making these changes, please don't hesitate to reach out to
our [Contact Studio Support](https://support.unstack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
:::

If your domain is managed by Shopify, the below steps can be followed to connect that domain to your Studio account. If
you haven't already, please begin this process by reviewing 
[Setting Up Custom Domain](/docs/studio/Settings/Domain-Management/Setting-up-your-Custom-Domain) within Studio.

For further assistance, we recommend that you check out the official documentation from Shopify which can
be [accessed here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/domains/managing-domains/advanced-settings).
