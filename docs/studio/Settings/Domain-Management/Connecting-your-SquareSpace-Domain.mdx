## Subscription note

If you're not on a paying plan you will not receive SSL or Root Domain Redirection. Due to this, you'll only see one DNS
record.

## This document has a prerequisite

You'll need to already have completed the steps in
our [custom domain configuration document](/docs/studio/Settings/Domain-Management/Setting-up-your-Custom-Domain).

With the 1-3 records you have within your Studio settings page, you'll follow these steps.

Here's a run-down of how we'll reference these records in a human-friendly way throughout this document:

| Record Name        | Record Type | Record Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WWW Record         | CNAME       | This record has a HOST of "www" and is named the www record since it hosts/establishes the hosting of your domain.     |
| Root Domain Record | A Record    | This record has a HOST of either nothing (blank) or "@" depending on your host. Within GoDaddy, you'll use "@."        |
| SSL Record         | CNAME       | This record has a HOST which begins with an underscore (\_) you'll need to verify the HOST and VALUE are both correct. |

1. In the **Home Menu**, click **Settings**, then click **Domains**. You can also press the "?" key while any panel is
   open and search domains. (If you're using a parking page, start by clicking the domain name in your parking page
   menu.)
2. Under **Squarespace Domains**, click the domain name. If you have multiple Squarespace domains, you'll manage their
   DNS settings separately.
3. Click **Advanced Settings** and scroll down to **Custom Records**.
4. In the **Record** field of a blank row, select the **Record type, Host(name),** and **Value.**
5. Click **Add.**

If you need
help, [contact the SquareSpace support team](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#choose-topic).

## Troubleshooting

If a \_\_\_ record with that host already exists, that means that this host is already present as a DNS record within
your SquareSpace account. Studio **cannot** advise on the deletion of records. (1) contact your technical manager for
help in deleting the issue-causing record(s) or (2) contact SquareSpace support for further help.
