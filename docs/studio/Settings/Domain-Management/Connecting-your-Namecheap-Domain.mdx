## Subscription note

If you're not on a paying plan you will not receive SSL or Root Domain Redirection. Due to this, you'll only see one DNS
record.

## This document has a prerequisite

You'll need to already have completed the steps in
our [custom domain configuration document](/docs/studio/Settings/Domain-Management/Setting-up-your-Custom-Domain).

With the 1-3 records you have within your Studio settings page, you'll follow these steps.

Here's a run-down of how we'll reference these records in a human-friendly way throughout this document:

| Record Name        | Record Type | Record Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WWW Record         | CNAME       | This record has a HOST of "www" and is named the www record since it hosts/establishes the hosting of your domain.     |
| Root Domain Record | A Record    | This record has a HOST of either nothing (blank) or "@" depending on your host. Within GoDaddy, you'll use "@."        |
| SSL Record         | CNAME       | This record has a HOST which begins with an underscore (\_) you'll need to verify the HOST and VALUE are both correct. |

1. Sign into your **Namecheap account** and Select **Domain List** from the left side menu and click the **Manage** button next to your domain.
2. Navigate to the **Advanced DNS** tab and click the **Add New Record** button in the Host Records section.
3. Within the dropdowns for select the according record type, Host(Name), and Value.

And, done! If you need help,
please [contact the Namecheap support team](https://www.namecheap.com/help-center/live-chat/?loc).

## Troubleshooting

If a \_\_\_ record with that host already exists, that means that this host is already present as a DNS record within
your NameCheap account. Studio **cannot** advise on the deletion of records. (1) contact your technical manager for
help in deleting the issue-causing record(s) or (2) contact NameCheap support for further help.
