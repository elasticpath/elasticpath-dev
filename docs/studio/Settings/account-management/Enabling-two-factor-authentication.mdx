4. Studio will send you an automated text message with your confirmation code, type in the code you received into the text box and click send and enable to complete the process.  
  
5. Now log out of your account and try logging back in to make sure it's working correctly. You'll know it's working correctly if you receive a confirmation code and the login screen prompts you to type it in before logging in.
