Once you have installed Elastic Path Studio, we recommend checking your branding to ensure that everything is displaying as you intended. From **Branding**, select **Make changes**. The Studio Style Guide is displayed. See [Using your Style Guide](/docs/studio/design/Design-&-Styles/Using-your-Style-Guide).

Once you are happy with your branding, you can start creating your landing pages. 

1. From **Create a new landing page**, you will now have several categories of templates that you can use. Select a template. The Studio page editor is displayed.
2. You can use the components in Studio to quickly and easily design your landing pages. See [Building your first landing page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Building-your-first-landing-page).
