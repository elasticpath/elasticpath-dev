Using Studio with Shopify enhances and extends the e-commerce capabilities of Shopify. You can use the themes and pages that you develop in Studio in your Shopify store.

### Step 1 - Create a Development Store in Shopify

:::caution

You must have access to the Shopify Partner dashboard.

:::

1. Go to the Shopify Partner Dashboard.
2. Create a development store.  
3. Configure the store depending on your requirements. For example, you can choose the purpose of the store, the store name, the Shopify build version, and whether to start the store with no data or some test data.
4. Shopify prompts you to choose your account.
5. Once the store is created, Shopify opens a new window with the store details. You can start configuring your store, for example adding products.

### Step 2 - Install the Elastic Path Studio App in Shopify

Once you have your development store created in Shopify, you can install Studio.  

1. From your Shopify store, search for **Elastic Path Studio** or navigate to the Shopify app store.
1. In the Shopify app store, the Elastic Path Studio app is displayed. Select **Install**.
1. Agree to the terms of service.
1. Shopify prompts you to specify information such as, what you want to do with Studio, how large your company is and the category that best describes your brand.
1. Once Elastic Path Studio is installed, we recommend that you pin it to your Shopify dashboard. Otherwise, if you navigate away from your Shopify store, you will have to search for Elastic Path Studio.

### Step 3 - Check your Studio Branding

Once you have installed Elastic Path Studio, we recommend checking your branding to ensure that everything is displaying as you intended. From **Branding**, select **Make changes**. The Studio Style Guide is displayed. See [Using your Style Guide](/docs/studio/design/Design-&-Styles/Using-your-Style-Guide).

### Step 4 - Create your Landing Pages

Once you are happy with your branding, you can start creating your landing pages. 

1. From **Create a new landing page**, you will now have several categories of templates that you can use. Select a template. The Studio page editor is displayed.
2. You can use the components in Studio to quickly and easily design your landing pages. See [Building your first landing page](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Building-your-first-landing-page).
