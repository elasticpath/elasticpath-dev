Many aspects of your theme can be customized in the Style Guide, including:

* Branding
* Typography
* Button styles
* Forms styles
* Layout
* And more...

If you're not sure if Studio has a no-code way of customizing your theme, the Style Guide is a great place to start. Component developers will especially want to be familiar with what's exposed here.
