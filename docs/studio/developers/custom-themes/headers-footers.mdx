Studio enables you to customize your site's appearance.

Within the app, Studio provides a way of customizing your header and footer without code:

This allows you to customize your menus, styles, and the basic layout of your header. The built-in header and footer do have some limitations, but they are excellent for customizing your header or footer without code.

If the built-in header and footer don't meet your needs, you can also build your own header and footer components with code. See [Header and Footer](/docs/studio/developers/components/header-and-footer).
