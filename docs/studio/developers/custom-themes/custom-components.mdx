Studio enables you to customize your site's appearance.

Building your own components will give you the ultimate flexibility. Studio provides a simple component editor where you can develop components in a live preview environment:

The component editor can be used to build a few different types of components:

* [**Sections**](/docs/studio/developers/components/section) - The main building blocks of Studio pages.
* [**Headers & Footers**](/docs/studio/developers/components/header-and-footer) - If the built-ins don't work for you you can go custom.
