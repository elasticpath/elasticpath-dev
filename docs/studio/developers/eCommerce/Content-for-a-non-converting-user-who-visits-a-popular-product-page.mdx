Want to show content to users who visited a specific page of yours, but didn't convert? You can use the "Visited a
page..." condition to do just this.

:::note
When using this condition, you aren't able to define pages that aren't hosted through Studio. Therefore you're unable
to target pages on your Shopify site at this time.
