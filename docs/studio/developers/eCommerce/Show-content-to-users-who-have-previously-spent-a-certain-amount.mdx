When using the "Total value of all purchases" condition in Studio, you're able to show two different discount codes
your users.

As an example, the below image is an example of how you might entice returning shoppers to convert a second time, while
offering a better discount for users who have never purchased through your site before.

1. The first for users who have already purchased something through your site
2. The second for users who have never purchased something through your site

   ***As the title of this guide implies*** - you can also use this condition to show content to users who have spent a
   certain amount with your store. In the below example, the same "Total value of all purchases" condition is being used
   to
   offer VIP customers (users who have previously spent >$100) the chance to join a VIP email list.
