What if we told you that you could take the search term that your user's input into Google Search, and include the
search terms right in your pages? Well,
with [conditional content](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/Using-Conditional-Content)
and [dynamic text content](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/Using-Dynamic-Text-Content) you can do just this. Below are
two examples of how you can set this up.

One uses the "**Visited from...**" condition for both conditions, and the other uses the "**URL query params...**"
condition. Feel free to mix and match here to achieve your desired result.

Keep in mind that the way this section is configured, this will only work for Google Ads. That said, there are certainly
other ways to go about setting this up for things like Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, TikTok Ads, etc. Feel free to reach
out to our team if you have any specific use cases around this that you need help with!
