For optimal performance, especially with large product collections, you should paginate your product collection component, rendering your products one page at a time instead of loading the entire product collection. Pagination makes it easier for your shoppers to browse through your product catalogs, allowing them to quickly find what they are looking for. In addition, you can choose from a selection of visually engaging indicator types and transitions. For example, if your indicator type is an arrow, then you might want to use a slide transition.

You can choose from the following indicator types:

- dots

- page numbers

## Prerequisites

You must enable pagination for the product collection component. See [Product Collection](/docs/studio/developers/e-commerce/product-collection#pagination).

You can configure the style of your pagination indicator types in [Style Guide](/docs/studio/design/Design-&-Styles/Using-your-Style-Guide).
