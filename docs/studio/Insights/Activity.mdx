Activity is a feature found in the "Reports" tab of the Studio main menu that allows you to track the activity of
visitors on your Studio site.

This includes page views, unique views and even the average time spent on a page.

You can view these metrics for the last 90, 30 or 7 days for your site overall, or you can set views to see the metrics
for Web, Landing, and blog pages.
