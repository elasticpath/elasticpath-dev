[**Studio**](https://www.elasticpath.com/products/studio) is an e-commerce enabled content management system designed to empower your team to build exceptional experiences. Studio includes many features that make it easier for designers, developers, and marketers to work together doing what they each do best:

* **Developers** can build rich components that become the building blocks for other team members to assemble pages
* **Designers** can quickly customize branding and styles
* **Marketers** can build out pages and adjust content to suit

Studio ships with **over 40 pre-built block components** that make it easy to build pages. Each of these can be customized with your own code and styles. You can also [build your own components](/docs/studio/developers/components/section).

By default, Studio is pre-configured with sane defaults, but there are [many ways to customize your theme](/docs/studio/developers/custom-themes).
