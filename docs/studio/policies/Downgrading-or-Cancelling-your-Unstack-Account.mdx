## SaaS Customers

Please be aware that our support team requires you to fill out the form linked below for your downgrade/cancelation
request to be formalized. If you're charged before your request is formalized, we **will not be able to** issue a
refund.

## Shopify Customers

When your trial runs out you will automatically be charged. If you do not wish to be charged ensure that you remove
*Studio Page Builder* from Shopify before your trial end date. We **are not able** to provide refunds once you've been
charged.

To begin your downgrade or cancellation request, we require that you formalize your request by selecting the
corresponding option below.

This will bring you a form, which once submitted, means the request has been formalized. Following this submission
you'll receive notice at the email provided in the form that the request has been received by our Support Team. Please
allow up to **one** business day for them to respond.

## Our Policies

**Site security policy**

Only the site owner may reach out or submit a request; should a non-site owner submit a request, we consider this an
unauthorized request. Thus, any requests regarding billing made from this user will not be considered valid.

**Access to features**

When you request a downgrade, we'll automatically move your site to that subscription plan. Thus, you'll lose access to
the features included with your current subscription-tier upon the date of your request, not the end date of your
current billing period.

**Can I receive a refund for unused time?**

We do not provide prorated refunds. We will only refund a user if they are charged for their subscription **after** their
downgrade/cancellation request's **formalization date**.

**What is a formalization date?**

The formalization date is a specific date referenced alongside downgrade/cancellation requests. This date is the day
your
downgrade form was submitted by the **site owner**.
