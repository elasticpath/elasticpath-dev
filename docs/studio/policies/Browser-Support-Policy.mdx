## Studio Sites & Landing Pages

For pages that run on Studio, we strive to support both mobile and desktop browsers for versions that are
***less than a year old***.

| Desktop         | Mobile             |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Microsoft Edge  | Android Chrome     |
|                 | Android Firefox    |
| Google Chrome   | iOS/iPadOS Safari  |
| Mozilla Firefox | iOS/iPadOS Chrome  |
| Apple Safari    | iOS/iPadOS Firefox |

All Studio templates are built to support the browsers listed above. We are not however responsible for maintaining
browser support for code that you add to your site. This includes third-party integrations, custom code blocks, and your
own custom-made section components.

If you are experiencing problems with one of the browsers listed above, check your browser version to see when it was
last updated, and [reach out to our Support team](https://support.unstack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if it was updated
in the last year. Problems with unsupported browsers may take a lower priority.

## Admin Portal

For the Admin portal, we strive to support the ***most recent versions*** of the major desktop web browsers:

| Desktop (Only)  |
|-----------------|
| Microsoft Edge  |
| Google Chrome   |
| Mozilla Firefox |
| Apple Safari    |

If you are experiencing problems, please upgrade to the latest version of one of the browsers above.
Otherwise, [reach out to our Support team](https://support.unstack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
