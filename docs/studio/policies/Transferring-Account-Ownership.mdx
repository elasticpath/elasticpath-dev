## What happens if the Account Owner is unavailable?

Support cannot adjust the account owner for you unless the current account owner authorizes it through their verified
email (or they verify themselves through another email).

## What is the account owner left the company?

We'll reach out to them to verify these details. We'd also need internal documents proving this occurred. We cannot
accept these documents/details from emails outside the domain the original email is.

## What if the account owner has passed or fallen ill?
