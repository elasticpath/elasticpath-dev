:::caution
If you create a form that doesn't include the standard email field, you will get a warning from Studio when you go to
add that form to a page.
:::

The reason for this warning is that without an email, Studio isn't able to save the leads as contacts (we use the email
as the root of the contact). That said, we ***will*** still try to send lead data collected by this form to any
integrations that you have configured.
