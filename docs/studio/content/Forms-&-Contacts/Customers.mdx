The "Customers" section of the Studio Admin is where you can see a full list of the contacts that you've collected
using [Studio Forms](/docs/studio/content/Forms-&-Contacts/Building-Forms) Other than the search bar, there are
a number of filter options that you can use to find the contact(s) you're looking for. These are as follows:

| Filter          | Description                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| All Contacts    | Shows all contacts/leads acquired on Studio.            |
| New Contacts    | Contacts that are acquired within the last 30 days.        |
| Repeat Visitors | Contacts that visit your site at least once every 30 days. |
| Slipping Away   | Contacts with no activity on the site in 60+ days.         |

Within an individual customer/contact there are three tabs that have various purposes:

- Activity: The activity tab is where you'll see a log of that user's activity. This includes things like referral
  sources, form
  submissions, page views, etc.

  Additionally, on this screen you'll see a list of properties in a panel to the right. This is a collection of the
  various pieces of information that the customer/contact has provided via any Studio form submissions. There are a
  number of standard fields here, but we also show the values of hidden fields if there are any.

- Tasks: The tasks section can be used to assign individual tasks to people who have been added to your team in Studio.
  These
  are specific to the customer/contact and won't show up anywhere else.

- Notes: The notes section can be used to leave notes for other members of your team. These are specific to the
  customer/contact
  and won't show up anywhere else.
