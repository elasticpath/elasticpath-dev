Upon clicking that option, a sidebar will open displaying all the available settings for your blog. Below are the
definitions and options for each setting.

- **Title**: Define a public-facing title for the blog. This is also what is used when your browser needs a title for
  the tab.
- **Category URL Structure**: This field is not editable and has a single value: `/{blog}/{category}/`
- **Article URL Structure**: There are four options available here:

    - `/{blog}/category/{article}`

    - `/{category}/{article}`
    - `/{article}`

- **URL**: Define the URL where the blog should be found.

- **Hide From Search Engines**: Want to hide your entire blog from being indexed by search engines? Enable this option and we'll prevent them from being able to index your blog.

## Blog Categories

Categories are an organizational tool that you can use with your articles in Studio. They allow for a further degree of
organization and make it easier for you and your users to find articles about specific topics.

To manage the settings of your categories, select "*Categories*" from the top left of your screen. This opens a menu
where you can either select the category you'd like to edit, or create a new category outright.

If you select "Create New Category" you'll be brought to a separate screen (Image #3) with a variety of options that you
need to set before you can create your category. You'll find definitions for all these options below:
