definitions and options for each setting.

  the tab.

- **Article URL Structure**: There are four options available here:

    - /{blog}/category}/{article}

## Blog Categories

Categories are an organizational tool that you can use with your articles in Studio. They allow for a further degree of
organization and make it easier for you and your users to find articles about specific topics.

To manage the settings of your categories, select "*Categories*" from the top left of your screen. This opens a menu
where you can either select the category you'd like to edit, or create a new category outright.

If you select "Create New Category" you'll be brought to a separate screen (Image #3) with a variety of options that you
need to set before you can create your category. You'll find definitions for all these options below:
