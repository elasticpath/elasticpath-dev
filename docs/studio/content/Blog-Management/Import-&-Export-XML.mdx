:::note
It's not currently possible to bulk import externally-created website or landing pages, nor is it currently possible to
export Studio-created website or landing pages.

If you're subscribed to either our *Full* or *Full+* plan, you're able to both import and export blog articles into your
account. You'll find both of these options under ***Settings*** > ***General*** > ***Advance SEO Features***.

- Export XML: Selecting ***Export XML*** will download a file to your computer named *content.xml* that contains the
  contents of all
  the articles in your account, regardless of category.
- Import XML: Selecting ***Import XML*** will prompt you to select an XML file to import to your account. There are not
  currently
  controls built in to determine what from the XML should be brought in. Everything in the file will be imported, even
  if
  an identical article exists.

If you get an error message when importing the XML file, we recommend that you use a 3rd party XML
validator ([like the one found here)](https://validator.w3.org/feed/#validate_by_input) to identify the issue preventing
it from uploading properly.
