**What does the "Generate dynamic pages for tags" option under Advanced SEO Features do?**

This allows you to have access to [creating tags](/docs/studio/content/Blog-Management/Adding-tags-to-blog-posts) on your
blog posts and also access to dynamic pages, which are similar to blog categories but created automatically after
creating a tag. Dynamic pages display all articles that are associated with the particular tag and behave just like
category pages.

Dynamic pages are index pages that update with posts that have that tag associated. These dynamic pages can be accessed
through the tags on the live version of the article.
