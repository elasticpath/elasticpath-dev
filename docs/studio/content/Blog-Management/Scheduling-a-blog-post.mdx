## Hey hey, don't forget...

Scheduling an article relies on the timezone of your account, so don't forget to check that you have the correct
timezone setup. See [Setting Your Timezone in Studio](/docs/studio/Settings/account-management/Setting-your-Timezone-in-CX-Studio).

1. Open the **Settings** drawer for the article you're currently editing.
2. Once the settings drawer is expanded scroll to the **Authored date** input, if you set this to the future settings
   for scheduled publishing will appear. You'll additionally have the option to **Publish now with future date** which
   means it'll be live for the world immediately, however, it will present with the future date you've inputted.

   drawer
