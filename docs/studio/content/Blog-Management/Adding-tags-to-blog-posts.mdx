Similar to blog categories, you can create tags on blog posts articles that link together with other articles that have
this same tag.

:::note
In order for the tags option to show, make sure you have the "Generate dynamic pages for tags" box checked under your
account settings.

To create tags, head to a blog article, open it's settings, and scroll down until you see the new option titled "tags".

To input a new tag, type in the name of the tag and hit the "enter" key on your keyboard.

:::note
Tags cannot be deleted, and can be duplicated if typed into the tag field multiple times.
