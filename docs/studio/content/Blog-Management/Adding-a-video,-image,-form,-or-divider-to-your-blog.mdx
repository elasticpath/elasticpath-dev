## Current Embed Support

Currently you can embed the following into your Studio articles: YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Transistor, Buzzsprout, and
SoundCloud.

1. Create a new line by pressing the ``````<Enter>`````` key.
2. Once you're on a new, empty line you'll see a greyed plus icon to the
   right of your cursor.

3. Click the greyed plus icon to expand a tray of options. Via these tray options is how you're able to add an image, divider, video or form to your article.
