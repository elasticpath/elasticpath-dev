As covered in the above video, setting a section to **Content Height** will have the section accommodate the contents
of the component along with the padding set at either the section or element level.

In comparison, **Screen Height** will force the section to fill the entire screen (or viewport) of the viewing device
and will disregard the padding set at the section or element level.
