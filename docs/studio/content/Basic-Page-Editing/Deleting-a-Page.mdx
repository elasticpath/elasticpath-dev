Keep in mind, deleting pages **cannot** be undone. Additionally, our Support team does not have the ability to recover a
deleted page for you.

1. Click the vertical **...** to the right of the page you'd like to delete.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the modal that opens.
3. Click the delete button then follow the confirmation prompts.
