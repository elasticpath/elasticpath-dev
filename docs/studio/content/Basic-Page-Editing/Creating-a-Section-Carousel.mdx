Through the below guide you'll learn how to configure a section to "carousel". Once configured, the carousel will
automatically scroll through multiple sections at a set interval allowing your site to show multiple versions of a
section (or different sections all together).

2. After clicking the carousel icon you'll now be able to add up to **five** additional sections to this section (
   refered to as *Slides*) via the (+) button shown below. In other words, additional sections can now be added to here
   and the page will rotate through them according to the settings you define.

3. Clicking on the carousel icon once more will toggle a specific
   carousel-toolbar which is where the transition time, transition speed, and animation style for the carousel is
   controlled.
