Smart links are how you links to resources hosted within Studio. You can then use your smart links, in a button, for example.

Below is the full list of resources that you are able
to create smart links for.

- Pages: Landing pages, webpages, and blog articles can be found in the smart link search.
- Products: For our ecommerce users, you can link your products to create in-line add to cart buttons, wherever you might need them. See [Product](/docs/studio/developers/e-commerce/product).
- Elastic Path Composable Commerce promotion codes: If you have created promotions in Elastic Path Composable Commerce, you can now add your promotion codes to a smart links menu. This enables you to create buttons that add promotions to a cart and a checkout, for example.

    Enter your coupon in the format **[coupon: *code-name*]** where *code-name* is your promotion code, for example, **SAVEMONE2024**. For more information about promotion codes in Elastic Path Composable Commerce, see [Promotion Codes](/docs/rule-promotions/rule-promotion-codes/create-rule-promotion-codes).
    
- PDFs: Any PDFs that have been uploaded to Studio can be found and linked to via the smart link search.
- Forms: If you've created an form through Studio, you can create a smart link to it! When this link is clicked the form will
  popup in the middle of the screen. (Currently this functionality is limited to Studio Forms).
