## What is parallax?

It's a visual effect that makes the background scroll at a different speed than the visitor.

## How to set this up

You'll set this up by first selecting a scroll speed for your background media.

Simply select the scroll speed then play around with it, the editor will demo how this will look to help you pick the
right scroll speed.
