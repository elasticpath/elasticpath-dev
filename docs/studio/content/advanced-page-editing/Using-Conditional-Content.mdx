Want to control the visibility of individual sections on your page from a certain user, group of users, or user's who
have completed a specific action? With Studio's Conditional Content you're able to do just that.

<iframe class="vidyard_iframe" title="Using Conditional Content to personalize pages" src="//play.vidyard.com/b8ePXf4mYZ4zPhxVJ6kFbB.html?" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

To enable Conditional Content on your section, just select the **{...}** icon from the section toolbar.

Now you need to decide on the conditions for this section to appear. Do you want it to show for all new users? Only
users who have been to this page before? What about users from Google Ads, Klaviyo, or HubSpot?

By combining conditions, you're able to create rules for just about anything. Below is the full list of supported
conditions that you can use individually, or combine into **IF** statements or **AND** statements:

## URL Query Parameters

![URL Query Parameters](/assets/studio/78cf4689-6faa-4c88-9a12-8894152c8b05.jpg)

This condition is used to show a section when a certain query parameter is true. You can use this condition to:

* [Show content to users in a specific location](/docs/studio/developers/eCommerce/Showing-content-to-users-in-a-specific-location)
* [Display search term in your landing pages](/docs/studio/developers/eCommerce/Displaying-search-term-in-your-landing-pages)

### Example

As an example, if you define your **URL query params...** condition as:

* **Param** --> **show**
* **Operator** --> **equals**
* **Value** --> **true**

then your section would only be visible to users who have **show=true** following the **?** in their URL.

```
URL Example: <https://www.unstack.com/example-page?show=true>
```

### Fields

The following table describes the fields that make up a URL query parameter.

unlikely that the condition you set here will work as you intended.
