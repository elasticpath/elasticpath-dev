## Redirecting an Studio page to another Studio page

1. Navigate to the Website tab in your Studio main menu and click on the 3 dots symbol to the right of the page you are
   wanting to redirect to. After clicking the 3 dots symbol that pages settings will open.

## Redirecting an Studio page to an external page

This can be done with something called **[meta refresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh)**. Follow the below
steps to implement this for yourself

1. Identify the page that you want to redirect, and the URL that you want to redirect to.
2. Create or edit the page in your Studio account that you want to redirect.
3. Add a Custom Code/Text or Custom Code section to that page and add the below meta tag to the code block. Don't forget
   to replace the **https://www.google.com**portion of it with the URL of the page you'd like to redirect the user to:

    ```
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.google.com">
    ```

4. Once added, publish the page and open the page in a new tab. As soon as the page loads, it refreshes and send the
   user to the URL you defined in the meta tag.
