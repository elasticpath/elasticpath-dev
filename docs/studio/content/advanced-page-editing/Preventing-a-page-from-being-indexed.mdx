## Overview

Indexing is when a search engine crawls a page/article and then displays that page for relevant searches. Blocking this
will make it so your page/article cannot be found through search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc., and can only be
found if someone directly visits the page's URL.

## How do I disable indexing?

1. Navigate to any Studio webpage in editor mode (landing page, blog article, content page).
2. Click the gear icon in the upper right corner.

3. Enable the check box for "Hide this page/article from search engines" within the page setting's danger zone (make
   sure to save and publish). This will prevent this page from being indexed by all index bots.
