Composer is a vertical-specific commerce intelligence IPaaS. 

With Composer, you can:

- Choose from more than 100 available third-party integrations or build custom components.
- Take actions on connections to build your integrations (via managing specific API calls, functions and data inputs).
- And monitor every component via a single pane of glass.

Under the hood, Composer is made up of three core services, aimed at removing the operational challenges and risk associated with Composable Commerce architectures.

## Builder

Builder provides a low code environment with more than 100 components and more than 3,000 possible actions available. Building new integrations from scratch has never been easier. Your developers can create functions and develop their own libraries of available integrations, and run them on a fully-managed cloud infrastructure. These components will inherit the operational management and underlying infrastructure of Composer.

You want the ability to offer unique commerce experiences to your customers. Rather than develop these components outside of a composable architecture and then assume the operational overhead and technical debt that comes along with maintaining this work in production, you can build your own integrations and receive native operational management, monitoring and performance delivery through Composer.

See [Builder](/composer/builder/overview).

## Monitor

Monitor provides an aggregated view of all of your integration activities with visibility into each execution and the ability to drill into the details of any execution. Filter the logs or executions screens to look for failures across all integrations or filter down to a specific integration or even a specific process flow within a specific integration. Monitor acts as an operational control panel for your business, providing your DevOps teams with one central environment through which to view and manage your federated architectures.

See [Monitor](/composer/monitor/logging).
