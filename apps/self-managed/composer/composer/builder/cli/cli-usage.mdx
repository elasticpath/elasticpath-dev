title: How to Use Composer's CLI Tool
description: Installing the prism CLI tool allows Composer users access to our API via the command line. You can also run CLI commands and get contextual help.
---

The Composer CLI tool allows you to interact with the Composer API programmatically so you can build, deploy, and support integrations from the command line.
The CLI tool is built using the [Composer API](/composer/builder/api/api-overview.mdx), so any action that can be completed through the web app or API can be completed through the CLI tool, as well.

## Installing the CLI Tool

[![Prism NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@prismatic-io%2Fprism.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/prism)

Composer's CLI tool, `prism`, is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/prism and can be installed using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install -g @prismatic-io/prism
# OR
yarn global add @prismatic-io/prism
```

Prism's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prismatic-io/prism), and serves as a great example for how to wrap the [Composer API](/composer/builder/api/api-overview.mdx).

## Authenticating with the CLI Tool

Once `prism` has been installed login by typing:

```bash
prism login
```

This will open a web browser for you to authenticate with your Composer credentials.
Once you authenticate, your CLI tool will store an authentication token for subsequent `prism` commands.

To verify that you are logged in you can run `prism me` to see information about your user.

```bash
prism me

Name: Alex Cooper
Email: alexander.cooper@progix.io
Organization: Progix Software
Endpoint URL: https://app.prismatic.io
```

If you want to view the authentication token that your CLI tool uses, run `prism me:token`.

```bash
prism me:token
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6Ik5lVV9aYzFNdFRrSE93bXB1T2ZlUCJ9.eyJodHRwczovL3ByaXNtYXRpYy5pby9lbWFpbCI6InRlc3QudXNlckBlbWFpbC5jb20iLCJodHRwczovL3ByaXNtYXRpYy5pby9sYXN0X2xvZ2luIjoiMzAyMS0wMS0wMVQwMDowMDowMC4wMDFaIiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wcmlzbWF0aWMtaW8udXMuYXV0aDAuY29tLyIsImF1ZCI6WyJodHRwczovL3ByaXNtYXRpYy5pby9hcGkiLCJodHRwczovL3ByaXNtYXRpYy1pby51cy5hdXRoMC5jb20vdXNlcmluZm8iXSwiaWF0IjoxNjEyMjA4NjQyLCJleHAiOjE2MTIyOTUwNDIsInNjb3BlIjoib3BlbmlkIHByb2ZpbGUgZW1haWwgb2ZmbGluZV9hY2Nlc3MifQ.iKQWx95vUWTxF62O3-mZFqHPgfapH7TQjsy-BunqWWDJrhk88byJpJQYy__hJE779qAahkEtZD914zgpZ8UnjGW0i_PUcCf5nZsDJBR-jfTEARCLmeVYge3Hy40BAFzj3eCcCouDFqxMNaD3oeXSjfizO9Cy_P-XKEkDdIOJ-rk
```

To clear your token from memory and log out, run `prism logout`.

:::tip Logging in to other regions
By default your data is stored in the US commercial region and `prism` authenticates against that region.
If your enterprise plan includes additional regions or private cloud, you will need to instruct `prism` to point to that region.
See [Integrations in Multiple Regions](/composer/builder/integrations-multiple-regions.mdx#logging-in-to-additional-regions-with-prism).
:::

## Running CLI Commands and Getting Help

All Composer CLI commands generally follow the form `prism COMMAND`.
For example, you can run `prism customers:list` to list all of your customers, or `prism integrations:create` to create an integration.
A full list of `prism` commands can be found on the [Composer CLI Command Reference](/composer/builder/cli/prism.mdx) page.

Typing `prism --help` will also list top-level commands that you can run.

```bash
prism --help

Build, deploy, and support integrations in Composer from the comfort of your command line

## Listing Resources

All types of prismatic resources (customers, components, integrations, instances, actions, etc.) have `:list` subcommands.
By default, list commands show basic information about the resource, like name and description, but additional information like resource ID can be displayed.
You can optionally select exactly what attributes of resources you want to list, you can filter the results, and you can format the results as CSV, JSON, or YAML.

```bash
prism components:list

 Label                   Public Description                                                                                   Version Category

```

### Listing Resource IDs

All Composer resources have unique IDs.
IDs are not displayed by default through `list` subcommands, but can optionally be displayed with the `--extended` flag.
For example, to see IDs for components, run

```bash
prism components:list --extended

 Id                                                               Key                     Label                   Public Description                                                                                   Version Category

```

### Configuring Columns of a List to Display

You can optionally choose which attributes of a resource to display using the `--columns` flag.
For example, to get the Key, Label, and ID of all components, you can run

```bash
prism components:list --columns key,label,id

 Key          Label           Id
 ──────────── ─────────────── ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```

### Filtering List Output

You can filter the output that a `:list` subcommand displays using a `--filter` flag.
For example, to only show the component with the key "aws-s3", run

```bash
prism components:list --filter 'key=^aws-s3$'

 Label     Public Description                                   Version Category
 ───────── ────── ───────────────────────────────────────────── ─────── ──────────────
 Amazon S3 true   Manage files within an Amazon (AWS) S3 bucket 34      Data Platforms
```

:::note Filter uses regex
The `--filter` flag uses [regex](https://regexr.com/) pattern matching, hence the "start of string" `^` character, and "end of string" `$` character.
:::

In a bash script, you can combine the `--filter` flag with the `--columns` and `--no-header` flags to get the ID of a specific resource

```bash
AWS_S3_COMPONENT_ID=$(prism components:list --filter 'key=aws-s3' --no-header --columns id)
echo ${AWS_S3_COMPONENT_ID}
Q29tcG9uZW50OjJlMDcyMGU4LTFjNTUtNDY1Ni04NzY0LTI1N2RmZDVhNTE3Mw==
```

### Formatting List Output

Lists can be optionally formatted as CSV, JSON, or YAML using the `--output` flag.
This flag can be combined with the `--columns FORMAT` and `--filter` flag, as well.
For example, if you want id and key of all components in CSV format, run

```bash
prism components:list --output csv --columns id,key

Id,Key
Q29tcG9uZW50OjNiODQ1NGVkLTE5MjEtNGYxNS04MDhmLTBlZjkxNDEzNGRhZA==,airtable
Q29tcG9uZW50OjE5YWYzMzQzLTU2OWQtNDY0Yy1iNTAwLWUzM2RhNjg3YmQxYQ==,aws-dynamodb

Q29tcG9uZW50OmEyNjRjMTVkLThjM2QtNGY0Yi1hNDNkLWEzYzMzZjgxZGY0MQ==,aws-ses
Q29tcG9uZW50OjRmNTM5MWVkLWE3ZDEtNDljZi1hNjViLTE4ZGNmMTRmNGJlMA==,aws-sns
Q29tcG9uZW50OmQ0YjhmOTllLWU3YTYtNDUxMS04YWIxLWNkOGQ1M2QyNDJiZg==,aws-sqs
```

## Using the Composer CLI in Bash Scripts

Multiple `prism` commands can be strung together to manage prismatic resources.
For example, to create an instance you need to know the ID of the integration, and the ID of the customer you want to deploy an instance to.
You can use `customers:list`, `integrations:list` and `instances:create` commands together to create a new instance.

```bash
# Get the Customer ID
CUSTOMER_ID=$(
  prism customers:list \
    --columns id \
    --filter 'Name=^FTL Rockets$' \
    --no-header)

# Get the Integration ID
INTEGRATION_ID=$(
  prism integrations:list \
    --columns id \
    --filter 'name=^Acme$' \
    --no-header)

# Get the integration's latest version ID
VERSION_ID=$(
  prism integrations:versions ${INTEGRATION_ID} \
    --columns id \
    --latest-available \
    --no-header)

# Create the instance
prism instances:create \
  --customer ${CUSTOMER_ID} \
  --integration ${VERSION_ID} \
  --name 'Acme ERP' \
  --description 'Sync data with Acme ERP'
```

## Headless prism Usage for CI/CD Pipelines

If you would like to use `prism` on a headless (no GUI) server for CI/CD or scripting purposes, you will need to log in on a system that has a web browser and then transfer your "refresh token" to the headless system.
Refresh tokens do _not_ expire, and are used to generate short-lived access tokens for Composer's API.

After logging in to `prism` with `prism login`, get your refresh token with `prism me:token --type refresh`.
Take note of your token, and the API endpoint that you are currently using (see that with `prism me`).

Now, on our headless CI/CD system, set an environment variable `PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN` with the value you found.
If you use

```bash
export PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN=my-refresh-token
```

If you're working with [regions](/composer/builder/integrations-multiple-regions.mdx) other than the default US commercial region, you can also specify an endpoint:

```bash
export PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN=my-refresh-token
export PRISMATIC_URL=https://app.eu-west-1.prismatic.io
```

If your app uses a white-labeled domain (like integrations.my-company.com), you can use that endpoint instead for `PRISMATIC_URL`.

**Note**: If you are using PowerShell on a Windows machine, you can set an environment variable with this syntax:

```powershell
$ENV:PRISMATIC_URL=https://app.eu-west-1.prismatic.io
```

## Autocomplete in Prism

Enable autocomplete in `prism` by running `prism autocomplete` and then follow the instructions that are displayed.
Instructions are different depending on which shell you use (bash, zsh, etc.).

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

Misconfiguration of [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) can result in odd behaviors for a Node-based package like `prism`.
Here are a couple of common problems with their respective solutions:

#### Error: spawn cmd.exe ENOENT

When you run `prism login` from within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you might see `Error: spawn cmd.exe ENOENT`.
This is a problem with the WSL distribution's `PATH` environment variable.
Ensure that your `PATH` environment variable contains `System32`, which is where `cmd.exe` is located.
Usually, you can run something like this:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Windows/System32
```

#### Error: spawn xdg-open ENOENT

If you run `prism login` in a headless Linux environment (a Linux environment without a desktop or web browser such as an Ubuntu server or docker container), `prism` will be unable to open a GUI web browser to authenticate you.
You might see an error that reads `Error: spawn xdg-open ENOENT` or `Error: Exited with code 3`.

You will need to authenticate on a computer with a desktop environment and web browser, and set the refresh token you receive as an environment variable on the headless server.
See [Headless prism Usage for CI/CD Pipelines](#headless-prism-usage-for-cicd-pipelines).

#### prism: command not found

If you have followed the [instructions above](#installing-the-cli-tool) to install `prism`, but then see `prism: command not found` on Linux or MacOS, or `'prism' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file` on Windows when you run `prism`, you likely don't have your NodeJS `PATH` configured correctly.
Ensure that your `PATH` environment variable contains the `bin/` directory of your NodeJS installation.
