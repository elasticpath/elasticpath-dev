## Overview

This tutorial will walk you through some basic concepts of integration development.
You will:

- Fetch data from an API
- Learn how data flows between steps of an integration
- Use a loop to iterate over the records you fetch
- Use logical branches to determine what to do with each record
- Send certain records to another system (this example uses Slack)

## Integration overview

The integration you build here will fetch data (a list of to-do tasks) from an API, loops over the list, determine which tasks are marked "incomplete", and notify you via Slack of any "incomplete" tasks.
We'll use a placeholder API to stand in for the to-do list "API" - https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/todo.

You'll design this integration to be **configurable**, so the same integration can be deployed to multiple customers with unique API endpoints and Slack credentails and channel names.

## Let's build!

You're encouraged you to follow along with the video above, or steps below.
If you'd like to import a completed integration, you can download this integration's YAML definition [here](pathname:///docs/samples/my-first-integration.yml).

As you build, you'll pull data from this API endpoint: `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/todo`

You will need to create a Slack app and have access to a Slack workspace, which you can do for free at https://slack.com/.
Be sure to assign your Slack app the `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, and `channels:read` scopes.
Docs for creating a Slack app can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics).

### Create a new integration

From the integrations page, click the **New Integration** button.
Select **Quickstart** to create a new integration from scratch.
Then, give your integration a name like "My First Integration."

  alt="Create a new integration"
/>

### Fetch data from an API

Next, add a new step to your integration by clicking the **+** button below your trigger.
Search for the **HTTP** endpoint and add a **GET Request** step.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/add-http-get-step.png"
  maxWidth="450px"
  alt="Add an HTTP GET step"
/>

Configure your **GET Request** step to fetch data from the to-do API endpoint - `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/todo`.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-http-get-step.png"
  maxWidth="550px"
  alt="Configure HTTP GET step"
/>

Finally, click the green **Run** button on the bottom of your screen to test your integration so far.
If you select the **Get Request** step in your test runner drawer at the bottom of your screen, you will be able to expand the **results** section in the **Output** tab on the right to see the data that was fetched from the API.

  alt="HTTP GET step results"

### Loop over the records

Now that we're fetching an list of to-do tasks, we need to loop over each task to determine which ones are incomplete.
To do this, we'll add a **Loop** step to our integration.
Add another step under your **GET Request** step, this time searching for the **Loop** component and its **Loop Over Items** action.

Configure your loop step to loop over the `results` property of the previous step. You can do that by clicking **Configure Reference** in the loop step's configuration panel, and selecting the `results` property of the **Get Request** step.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-loop-step.png"
  maxWidth="750px"
  alt="Configure loop step"
/>

Run a test of your integration again.
This time, you'll see that the loop step has a **currentItem** property in its output that contains the data for the current item that is being looped over.
We'll use this property in the next step to determine if the current item is incomplete.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/loop-step-results.png"
  alt="Loop step results"
/>

### Identify complete items

Now that we're looping over each item, we need to determine if the current item is complete or not.
`completed` is a boolean property on each item that indicates whether or not the item is complete.

Add a step within your loop - select the **Branch** component, **Branch on Expression** action.
Configure the branch step to have a condition called **Is Complete?**.
Select the loop step's **currentItems.completed** property as the **Field** input, and under **Operator** select **is true**.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-branch-step.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Configure branch step"
/>

Now, steps that have `completed: true` will follow the **Is Complete?** branch, while steps that have `completed: false` will follow the **Else** branch.

### Send incomplete items to Slack

Next, we want to send a message to Slack for each incomplete item.
Within the **Else** branch, add a **Slack** component, **Post Message** step.

Up until now, steps we've added have not required additional connection configuration or credentials.
This step will take additional setup.
Make sure that you have created a Slack OAuth app and have access to a Slack workspace ([see docs](/composer/builder/builder-components/slack.mdx#slack-oauth-20)).

Click the **Configuration Wizard** button on the top of your screen and edit your **Slack Connection** config variable.
Enter your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Signing Secret** from the Slack app you created.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/slack-connection-config.png"
  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Slack connection configuration"
/>

Configure your test runner to use your test Slack workspace by clicking **Test Configuration** on the bottom of the screen, and select **Test-instance configuration** - that will open up a configuration wizard for your test instance.

Now, configure the Slack step to send a message to a channel in your Slack workspace.
For now, hard-code a channel name like `general` in the **Channel Name** input - we'll make that dynamic in a moment.
Your **Message** input can be a template, concatenating a string like `Incomplete task: ` with the `currentItem.task` property.

  maxWidth="800px"
  alt="Configure slack step"
/>

Finally, run a test of your integration.
You should see messages in your Slack workspace for each incomplete task.

/>

### Make the integration configurable

Now that we have a working integration, let's make it configurable so that we can deploy it to multiple customers.
We'll make the Slack channel name configurable, as well as the API endpoint we're fetching data from.

First, we'll make the Slack channel name configurable.
Click the **Configuration Wizard** button on the top of your screen and crate a second **Config Page**.
Name it something like "Slack Configuration".
Then, add a new Config Variable.
Name it **Slack Channel** and choose **Picklist** as its **Data Type**.

We want our config variable to be a picklist of all the channels in our customer's Slack workspace.
We'll use a [data source](/composer/builder/configuration-wizard.mdx#config-variable-data-sources) to make the dropdown menu dynamic.
Select the Slack component's **Select Channel** data source, as shown here:

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/slack-channel-data-source.png"
  alt="Slack channel config variable"
/>

Next, add an additional **String** config variable called **API Endpoint**, and give it a default value of

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/api-endpoint-config-variable.png"
  maxWidth="750px"
  alt="API endpoint config variable"
/>

Finally, we need to update our integration to use these new config variables.
Update the HTTP step to use the **API Endpoint** config variable as the URL to fetch data from.
Then, update the Slack step to use the **Slack Channel** config variable as the channel name to send messages to.

<Screenshot
  filename="getting-started/build-first-integration/configure-slack-step-config-variable.png"
  maxWidth="500px"
  alt="Configure slack step config var"
/>

Run a test of your integration again and verify that it still works as expected.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You created your first integration! Here are a few things you should try next:

- Send your message to a different system, like [Microsoft Teams](/composer/builder/builder-components/ms-teams.mdx).
- Swap out the HTTP GET action for a different data source component (perhaps pull from an [SFTP](/composer/builder/builder-components/sftp.mdx) server)?
- Write your message out to a file in [Dropbox](/composer/builder/builder-components/dropbox.mdx) or [Amazon S3](/composer/builder/builder-components/aws-s3.mdx) instead of Slack.
