Builder offers a wide array of built-in components to accomplish a variety of things, like serializing data formats, invoking REST endpoints, or interacting with commonly-used SaaS platforms like AWS, Slack, or Dropbox. The majority of your integrations can likely be developed using these standard components.

For the portions of your integrations that are specific to your industry or product, we provide the ability to run custom code as part of your integration.
You can deploy your own code with short code component steps.

## The code component

The code component is used for smaller, integration-specific proprietary code.
If a problem cannot be solved with built-in components, but can be solved with a few lines of JavaScript, the code component is a good choice for you.
