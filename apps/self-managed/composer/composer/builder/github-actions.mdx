If you've purchased multiple Builder tenants, you likely build your integrations and components in one tenant that you've designated for development, and then publish them to other tenants that you've designated for production.

The Builder GitHub Actions allow you to automate the process of publishing your integrations and components that you've tested in your development tenant to your production tenant(s).

## Setting up authentication for GitHub Actions

Builder's [integration-publisher](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/prismatic-integration-publisher) and [component-publisher](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/prismatic-component-publisher) GitHub Actions use the [prism](/composer/builder/cli/cli-usage.mdx) CLI tool to publish integrations and components to Builder.
To authenticate the GitHub Actions with your Builder tenant(s), you'll need to create a Builder refresh tokens for each tenant.

To do that, install `prism` and log in, and then print your refresh token.
This example shows how to create a refresh token for a tenant in the Australia region:

```bash title="Create a Prism Refresh Token"
$ export PRISMATIC_URL=https://app.ap-southeast-2.prismatic.io

$ prism login
Press any key to open prismatic.io in your default browser:
Login complete!

$ prism me:token --type refresh
X-1111111111111111111111111111_00000000000000
```

### Set up GitHub secrets

Take note of the URL of the region you're working with as well as your refresh token from above.
Then, within your GitHub repo select **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
Save a new secret with whatever name you'd like (if you have one region, maybe call it `PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN`, or if you have multiple regions, you might call it `PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUSTRALIA`).

  alt="GitHub Actions secrets"
/>

The value of the secret should be the refresh token you generated above.

It may be helpful to make the Builder URL a GitHub variable as well, especially if you have multiple regions.

## Publishing components with GitHub Actions

To publish a component automatically, use the [component-publisher](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/prismatic-component-publisher) GitHub Action.
Your component should be checked out, dependencies installed, and built before running the action.

In this example, we check out our repository, install NodeJS, install dependencies with `yarn` (though you may use `npm`, `pnpm`, `bun`, etc), and then we build the component (again with `yarn` in our case).
This example also assumes that our component is located in the `components/acme-crm` directory - if your repository has the component at the root, you can remove the `working-directory` and `COMPONENT_PATH` lines:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/publish-component.yml"
name: Publish Acme Component

# Only run when code lands on the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # Build and publish Acme CRM component
  acme_component:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4.0.2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install
      - name: Build Acme CRM Component
        run: yarn build
        working-directory: components/acme-crm
      - name: Publish Acme CRM Component
        uses: prismatic-io/component-publisher@v1.1
        with:
          COMPONENT_PATH: components/acme-crm
          PRISMATIC_URL: ${{ vars.PRISMATIC_URL }}
          PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
```

In addition to the `COMPONENT_PATH`, `PRISMATIC_URL`, and `PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN` variables, the `component-publisher` action also accepts:

- **CUSTOMER_ID** (optional): The ID of the customer with which to associate the component. Use this if the component is for a specific customer..
- **COMMENT** (optional): Any comments to associate with the component.
- **SKIP_COMMIT_HASH_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of commit hash in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_COMMIT_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of commit URL in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_REPO_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of repository URL in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_PULL_REQUEST_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of pull request URL in metadata. Default is `false`.

When a `component-publisher` action completes, you will see a summary of the job in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.

:::note If no changes are detected, component publishing will be skipped
Builder detects if the component has changed since the last publish.
If no changes are detected, the component will not be published and instead of a summary screen you will see the message:

```
Component Not Published ðŸš«
A component with this signature is already published.
```

### Linking components to pull requests

When a component is published using the `component-publisher` action, the action will automatically include the commit hash, commit URL, repository URL, and pull request URL in the component metadata.
When the component is displayed in the UI, these links will be available to integration builders.
This is handy for tracking changes to your components.

## Publishing integrations with GitHub actions

To publish an integration automatically, use the [integration-publisher](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/prismatic-integration-publisher) GitHub Action.

This action requires a couple of parameters in addition to `PRISMATIC_URL` and `PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN`:

- **PATH_TO_YML** (required): The path to the integration yml file that is to be published.
  See our [docs](/composer/builder/integrations.mdx#exporting-an-integration) for more information on how to export an integration.
- **INTEGRATION_ID** (required): The ID of the integration to be published.
  The integration must be [imported _manually_](/composer/builder/integrations.mdx#importing-an-integration) once into the production tenant before it can be imported automatically with this action.
  Take note of the ID of the integration when it is imported, which can be found in your browser's URL bar - the ID starts with `SW5`.
- **SKIP_COMMIT_HASH_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of commit hash in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_COMMIT_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of commit URL in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_REPO_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of repository URL in metadata. Default is `false`.
- **SKIP_PULL_REQUEST_URL_PUBLISH** (optional): Skip inclusion of pull request URL in metadata. Default is `false`.

:::tip Ensure you export your integration with "LATEST" component verisons
If you've published a custom component 100 times in your dev tenant, and 2 times in your prod tenant, then `v100` in dev is equivalent to `v2` in prod.
When you export your integration select "with LATEST".
That will ensure that the integration importer will use the latest version of the component that is available in the tenant.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/publish-integration.yml"
name: Acme-Hooli Integration

# Only run when code lands on the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # Publish Acme-Hooli integration
  acme_hooli_integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Publish Integration Component
        uses: prismatic-io/integration-publisher@v1.1
        with:
          PATH_TO_YML: integrations/hooli-acme-integration.yml
          PRISMATIC_URL: ${{ vars.PRISMATIC_URL }}
          PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
          INTEGRATION_ID: ${{ vars.ACME_HOOLI_INTEGRATION_ID_US_PROD}}
          MAKE_AVAILABLE_IN_MARKETPLACE: false
```

When a `integration-publisher` action completes, you will see a summary of the job in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.

### Linking integration versions to pull requests

When an integration is published using the `integration-publisher` action, the action will automatically include the commit hash, commit URL, repository URL, and pull request URL in the integration metadata.
When the integration version is displayed in the UI in the version history drawer, these links will be available to integration builders.

## Ensuring your components are published before your integrations

If your integration depends on a custom component, you'll want to ensure that the component is published before the integration.
You can do this by adding a `needs` key to your integration job that references the component job.

In this example, we publish two components (`acme-crm` and `hooli-crm`) and one integration (`hooli-acme-integration`).
We also leverage the [paths-filter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/paths-changes-filter) action to only run publish steps when changes occurred in our component or integration.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/acme-hooli-integration.yml" {76}
name: Acme-Hooli Integration CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # Build and publish Acme CRM component

            acme_component:

        if: steps.filter.outputs.acme_component == 'true'

      - name: Note that component didn't change
        run: |
          echo "No changes detected for Acme component" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
        if: steps.filter.outputs.acme_component != 'true'

  # Build and publish Hooli CRM component

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - id: filter

          PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
        if: steps.filter.outputs.hooli_component == 'true'
      - name: Note that component didn't change
        run: |
          echo "No changes detected for Hooli component" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
        if: steps.filter.outputs.hooli_component != 'true'

  # Publish Acme-Hooli integration after components are published
  acme_hooli_integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [acme_component, hooli_component]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - id: filter
        uses: dorny/paths-filter@v3.0.2
        with:
          filters: |
            integration_or_components:
              - 'integrations/hooli-acme-integration.yml'
              - 'components/**'
      - name: Publish Integration Component
        uses: prismatic-io/integration-publisher@v1.1
        with:
          PATH_TO_YML: integrations/hooli-acme-integration.yml
          PRISMATIC_URL: ${{ vars.PRISMATIC_URL }}
          PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PRISM_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
          INTEGRATION_ID: ${{ vars.ACME_HOOLI_INTEGRATION_ID_US_PROD}}
          MAKE_AVAILABLE_IN_MARKETPLACE: false
        if: steps.filter.outputs.integration_or_components == 'true'
      - name: Note that integration didn't change
        run: |
          echo "No changes detected for integration or underlying components" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
        if: steps.filter.outputs.integration_or_components != 'true'
```

GitHub Actions waits until the component jobs are complete before starting the integration job.
