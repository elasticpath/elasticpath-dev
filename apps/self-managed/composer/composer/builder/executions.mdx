When a flow is triggered, an execution is started.
An execution is a single run of a flow.

Multiple events can [trigger](/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx) an execution:

1. You can set up your integration to run [on a schedule](/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#scheduled-triggers)
1. You can invoke them [through a webhook](/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#webhook-triggers)
1. You can configure your flow to run [on deployment](/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#instance-deploy-trigger) or [on instance removal](/composer/builder/integration-triggers.mdx#instance-remove-trigger)

A flow within an instance can be triggered mutliple times simultaneously resulting in multiple concurrent executions of a flow.

A flow can also trigger other flows within the same instance by calling sibling flows' webhook URLs.
Each flow invocation is a separate execution.

If an execution fails, or if you need to re-run an execution, you can [replay](/composer/builder/retry-and-replay.mdx) previous executions.

## Viewing execution step results

It's useful for debugging purposes to be able to see execution results of instance invocations.
Click the **Executions** tab from an instances page to see the logs and step outputs of each execution of the instance.
You can also view executions for all instances by clicking **Executions** on the left-hand sidebar.

If an instance failed to run to completion for whatever reason, you can review the data that was passed in to the instance when it was invoked, and that can help you to debug instances.

Results for all instances and all customers can be found by clicking the **Executions** link on the left-hand sidebar, and results for a specific customer can be found by clicking into a **Customer**, and then selecting their **Executions** tab.

## Fetching step results from the API

Step results can be fetched from the Builder GraphQL API using the `executionResult` query.
Step results are serialized with [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) and can be deserialized using the MessagePack library in your language of choice.

## Viewing execution logs

Logs for an instance can be viewed by clicking the **Logs** tab from the instance's page.
You can also view logs for all instances by clicking **Logs** on the left-hand sidebar, or for a specific customer by opening the customer's page and selecting the **Logs** tab.

You can search log message text through the **Search Logs** search bar on the top of the page, and you can filter logs by Log Severity or date range by clicking the **Filter** link to the right of the search bar.
