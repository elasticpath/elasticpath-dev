title: Using Field Mapping in a Flow
description: In this tutorial, you will learn how to use field mapping data in a flow.

If you've already built a [custom field mapper](/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/field-mapping-json-forms-datasource.mdx), the next step is to use the results of that field mapper to map data in a flow.


In the video above, we create a field mapper that maps Salesforce fields to "Acme" fields.
The result of the field mapper config variable is a JavaScript object that looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "source": "Id",
    "destination": "external_id",
  },
  {
    "source": "Name",
    "destination": "acct_name",
  },
  {
    "source": "AnnualRevenue",
    "destination": "revenue",
  },
];
```

Salesforce yields data that looks like this, with keys in [Pascal Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case):

```json
{
  "Id": "0018c0000321QvpAAE",
  "Name": "Example Account",
  "AnnualRevenue": 1000000
}
```

To map fields from the Salesforce payload to an "Acme" payload, we can apply a JavaScript [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) function onto the map config object:

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ logger, configVars }, stepResults) => {
  const sfdcAccount = stepResults.loopOverAccounts.currentItem;
  const mapping = configVars["Salesforce Account Field Mapping"];
  const mappedFields = mapping.reduce(
    (acc, { source, destination }) => ({
      [destination]: sfdcAccount[source],
      ...acc,
    }),
    {}
  );
  return { data: mappedFields };
};
```

That will yield an object that our "Acme" API can consume:

```json
{
  "external_id": "0018c0000321QvpAAE",
  "acct_name": "Taylor test account 5",
  "revenue": 10000
}
```
