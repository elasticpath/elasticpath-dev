Relates an Integration to a hierarchical structure of Component Actions
that define the behavior of one of potentially several workflows that
comprise the Integration.

## Return fields

###### <b>allowRemove</b> ([Boolean!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Boolean.mdx))

Specifies whether the signed-in User can remove the IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>allowUpdate</b> ([Boolean!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Boolean.mdx))

Specifies whether the signed-in User can update the IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>description</b> ([String](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx))

Additional notes about the IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>endpointSecurityType</b> ([IntegrationFlowEndpointSecurityType!](/composer/builder/api/schema/enum/IntegrationFlowEndpointSecurityType.mdx))

Specifies the security configuration to use for the endpoint of this IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>id</b> ([ID!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/ID.mdx))

The ID of the object

###### <b>isSynchronous</b> ([Boolean!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Boolean.mdx))

Specifies whether responses to Executions of this IntegrationFlow are synchronous. Responses are asynchronous by default.

The timestamp at which this IntegrationFlow was most recently executed as part of an Instance.

###### <b>name</b> ([String!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx))

The displayed name of the IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>organizationApiKeys</b> ([[String]](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx))

The API key(s) to use for the endpoint of this IntegrationFlow when the endpoint security type is 'organization'.

###### <b>retryDelayMinutes</b> ([Int!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx))

Specifies the delay in minutes between retry attempts of Executions of this IntegrationFlow.

###### <b>retryMaxAttempts</b> ([Int!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx))

###### <b>retryUniqueRequestIdField</b> ([Expression](/composer/builder/api/schema/object/Expression.mdx))

Specifies a reference to the data to use as a Unique Request ID for retry request cancellation.

###### <b>retryUsesExponentialBackoff</b> ([Boolean!](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Boolean.mdx))

A user-provided value that represents identity across multiple integration versions and across flow renames.

###### <b>testContentType</b> ([String](/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx))

Content type of the payload for testing this Integration Flow.

###### <b>testExecutionResults</b> ([InstanceExecutionResultConnection!](/composer/builder/api/schema/object/InstanceExecutionResultConnection.mdx))
