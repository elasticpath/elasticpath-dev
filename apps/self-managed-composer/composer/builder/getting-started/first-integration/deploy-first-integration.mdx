Now that you've [built your first integration](/composer/builder/getting-started/first-integration/build-first-integration.mdx), let's deploy the integration to a customer.
We use the term **instance** to describe a copy of an integration that has been configured for a specific customer, using some customer-specific configuration variables.

Note, you have the option to deploy your integration to a customer yourself, or you can add your integration to your integration marketplace, so your customers can configure and deploy instances themselves.
Learn more about your options [here](/composer/builder/instances.mdx#options-for-deploying-instances).

## Create a customer

Your software company has [customers](/composer/builder/customers.mdx).

For this example we will create a customer - "FTL Rockets".
You can choose another name if you would like.

Navigate to the customers screen by clicking **Customers** on the left-hand sidebar, and then click the **+ Add customer** button in the upper right.

Give your customer the name "FTL Rockets", and a description of your choice. Click the **Add** button.

## Deploy an instance

Open the customer you created and then open the **Summary** tab.
Click the **+ Add instance** link in the Instances card.

Select the integration you created and published from the menu, and give the instance a name and description of your choice.

Once your instance has been created, you will be brought to the instance's **Summary** tab. From here you can click the **Reconfigure** button in the top right to open the Config Wizard.

On the Config Wizard, you can customize **Slack Webhook URL** and **Todo API URL** for this customer (or leave the defaults).
Once you are satisfied with the configuration, click the **Finish** button at the bottom right.

You can now test the instance by clicking into the **Test** tab and clicking **Save and Run Test**.
You should get a Slack message, as you did before.

## Delete your deployed instance

Since Builder charges per deployed instance, and free accounts have a limit of 4 deployed instances, you probably want to delete this instance.
When you're ready, click the **Delete instance** button on the bottom of the **Summary** tab.

## Next steps

Your first integration has been deployed to one customer, but can be deployed to multiple customers now (each with their own API endpoint and Slack webhook URL).
In the next page you'll learn how to productize your integration and [prepare it for marketplace](/composer/builder/getting-started/first-integration/prepare-for-marketplace.mdx).
