In this section you'll learn how to set up your environment for custom component development.

## Operating system considerations

You can develop custom components on any operating system that supports NodeJS (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc).
If you use Windows, you may find it helpful to work in a Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) environment.

## Install NodeJS

Custom components are written in NodeJS (with TypeScript layered on top).
While many version of NodeJS can be used to build custom components, we recommend using the latest LTS version available on [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you install NodeJS, ensure that you can run both `node --version` and `npm --version`.

## Install an IDE

If you have a favorite code editor, use that.
We've found that [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works great for custom component development, but some of our developers prefer [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

It's not necessary, but if you use VS Code we've found the following extensions helpful:

- [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting
- [Version Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens) for showing the latest version for each package in package.json

VS Code has built-in TypeScript IntelliSense (auto-complete), but if you want to use the latest-and-greatest, you can also install the [TypeScript Nightly build extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

## Install the Builder CLI tool

The Builder CLI tool, `prism` is used for initializing and publishing custom components.
You can install it after installing NodeJS and `npm` with this command:

```bash title="Install prism"
npm install --global @prismatic-io/prism
```

Once you've installed `prism`, log in by typing `prism login`.
You'll be prompted to enter your Builder credentials, and then to authorize `prism` to access your Builder account.
Click **Accept**.

Once you've logged in, run `prism me` to verify that you are logged in.

```bash
$ prism me
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Organization: Example Corp - US Region
Endpoint URL: https://app.prismatic.io
```
