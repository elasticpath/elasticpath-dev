import { Launch } from "@mui/icons-material";

Builder provides a JavaScript library, [@prismatic-io/spectral](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prismatic-io/spectral), which provides [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type definitions for use in component development.
Spectral's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prismatic-io/spectral).

## Installation

To add spectral to a project, run

```bash
npm install @prismatic-io/spectral
```

Import `input`, `component`, `connection`, `trigger` and `action` types by adding the following to the top of your component code

```none
import { action, component, connection, input, trigger } from "@prismatic-io/spectral";
```

## Writing Custom components

Please see the [writing custom components](/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx) article to see how to use `@prismatic-io/spectral`.

If you are new to custom components, consider working through the [getting started guide](/composer/builder/getting-started/first-custom-component/set-up-environment.mdx) quickstart.
Then, see the [advanced custom components](/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/building-the-s3-component.mdx) quickstart to learn how to handle binary data and credentials, and see the [unit testing](/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/unit-testing-custom-components.mdx) quickstart to learn how to automatically test your custom components.
