title: Spectral 7.x Upgrade Guide
description: Upgrade your custom component from Spectral 6.x to 7.x

import Screenshot from "@site/src/components/screenshot";

Spectral 7.x is completely backwards-compatible with Spectral 6.x.
You can safely bump your version of Spectral from 6.x to 7.x without changes to your custom component code.

The focus of Spectral 7.x was improved instance deployment.
You can now create **Data Sources**.
Similar to triggers or actions, data sources use connections to reach out to a third-party API to gather data.
In this case, it gathers data to dynamically insert into a config variable in an instance configuration wizard.

Read more about the instance configuration wizard [here](/composer/builder/configuration-wizard.mdx/#config-variable-data-sources), and about writing your own data source [here](/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#writing-data-sources).
