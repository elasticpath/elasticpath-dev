:::caution Outdated Spectral Version
This page covers how to write and maintain a custom component using an outdated version of Spectral.
If you are about to start a new custom component, we strongly recommend you reference the most recent guide on [writing custom components](/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx).
You can update your component by following the **Upgrade Guides** in the sidebar to the left.
