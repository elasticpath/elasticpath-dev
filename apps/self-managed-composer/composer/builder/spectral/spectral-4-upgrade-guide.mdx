Spectral 4.x introduces the ability to write [component-specific triggers](/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#writing-triggers).
This version is purely additive, so very few changes to your code need to occur.

To start, update `@prismatic-io/spectral` to `^4.0.6` in your `package.json` file and then run `npm install` or `yarn install`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@prismatic-io/spectral": "^4.0.6"
  }
}
```

Next, optionally write some [triggers](/composer/builder/custom-components/writing-custom-components.mdx#writing-triggers) and add those triggers to your `component` definition:

```typescript {10}
export default component({
  key: "sampleComponent",
  public: false,
  display: {
    label: "Sample Component",
    description: "sampleComponent",
    iconPath: "icon.png",
  },
  actions: { myAction1, myAction2, myAction3 },
  triggers: { myTrigger1, myTrigger2 },
});
```
