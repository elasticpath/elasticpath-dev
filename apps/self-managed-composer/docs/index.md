[Elastic Path Composer](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/composer) is a hosted platform for integrating commerce services.

This plugin sends webhook events to [Elastic Path Composer](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/composer) when the following events occur in Self-Managed Commerce:

- Customer registered, authenticated, updated
- Shopping cart created, updated, deleted
- Shopping cart item created, updated, deleted
- Order released for fulfillment

This allows teams to build integrations which receive these events and trigger API requests to pre-built or custom components.
