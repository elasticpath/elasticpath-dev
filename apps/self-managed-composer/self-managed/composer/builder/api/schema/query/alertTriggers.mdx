| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `before`             | [`String`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                               | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `last` to implement backward pagination.          |
| `after`              | [`String`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                               | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `first` to implement forward pagination.          |
| `first`              | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                     | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `first` edges after the `after` cursor.  |
| `last`               | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                     | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `last` edges before the `before` cursor. |
| `offset`             | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                     |                                                                                                  |
| `isInstanceSpecific` | [`Boolean`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Boolean.mdx)                             | Filter for objects where isInstanceSpecific matches the specified value.                         |
| `orderBy`            | [`AlertTriggerOrder`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/AlertTriggerOrder.mdx)   | DEPRECATED. Prefer using sort_by instead as it allows ordering by many fields.                   |
| `sortBy`             | [`[AlertTriggerOrder]`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/AlertTriggerOrder.mdx) | Allows specifying many field and direction pairs to sort results by.                             |
