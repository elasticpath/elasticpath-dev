| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `before`        | [`String`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                                           | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `last` to implement backward pagination.          |
| `after`         | [`String`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/String.mdx)                                           | Specifies a cursor for use in combination with `first` to implement forward pagination.          |
| `first`         | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                                 | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `first` edges after the `after` cursor.  |
| `last`          | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                                 | A non-negative integer that specifies to return at most `last` edges before the `before` cursor. |
| `offset`        | [`Int`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/scalar/Int.mdx)                                                 |                                                                                                  |

| `orderBy`       | [`InstanceFlowConfigOrder`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/InstanceFlowConfigOrder.mdx)   | DEPRECATED. Prefer using sort_by instead as it allows ordering by many fields.                   |
| `sortBy`        | [`[InstanceFlowConfigOrder]`](/self-managed/composer/builder/api/schema/input_object/InstanceFlowConfigOrder.mdx) | Allows specifying many field and direction pairs to sort results by.                             |
