Access to logs is critical for building, deploying, and supporting integrations.
If an [alert monitor](/self-managed/composer/builder/monitoring-and-alerting.mdx) alerts your team to an instance behaving unexpectedly, your team needs to know precisely when an instance ran, the status of the instance's steps as they finished, and what happened if a step failed to run as expected.
Builder provides access to logs of all instance invocations and tests.

You can also elect to [stream logs](#external-log-streaming) to an external logging system.

## Log retention

Logs and step results are retained for 14 days and are purged thereafter.

### Disabling logs and step results

For compliance reasons your organization may need to disable the storage of logs and step results.
If you need to disable log and step result storage, please reach out to [support](mailto:support@prismatic.io) to discuss adjusting retention policies.
When log and step result storage is disabled, logs and step results are not stored in Builder's database, and are not available in the Builder web app.

If your organization has adjusted log and step result retention policies, you will see a toggle in the instance configuration wizard that allows you to disable log and step result storage for a specific instance.

## Viewing logs for all customers

To see logs for all instances for all of your customers, click the **Logs** link on the left-hand sidebar.
Here you will see log **messages**, their **timestamps** in your local time, the name of the **instance**, the name of the **integration** the instance was created from, and the name of the **customer** the instance was deployed to.

## Viewing logs for a specific customer

To view logs for a specific customer, click the **Customers** link on the left-hand sidebar.
Click into a customer, and then select the customer's **Logs** tab.
Here you will see log **messages**, their **timestamps** in your local time, the name of the **instance**, and the name of the **integration** the instance was created from.

**For More Information**:
[Customers](/self-managed/composer/builder/customers.mdx)

## Viewing logs for a specific instance

To view logs for a specific instance, access the instance either by clicking **Instances** on the left-hand sidebar and selecting an instance, or by clicking **Customers** on the left-hand sidebar, selecting a customer, and selecting an instance under the **Instances** tab.
Once in an instance, select the **Logs** tab.
Here you will see log **messages**, their **timestamps** in your local time, the name of the **integration** the instance was created from, and the name of the **customer** the instance was deployed to.

**For More Information**:
[Instances](/self-managed/composer/builder/instances.mdx)

## Searching and filtering logs

You can **search** for specific messages in logs by typing part of the message into the **Search Logs** search bar on the top of any log page.

For more information on a specific log line, clicking the log line will bring up an additional information panel on the bottom of the screen.

Additionally, you can **filter** logs by **Log Severity** (Error, Warn, Info, Debug), by **Timestamp**, or by **Integration** by clicking the **Filter** drop-down to the right of the search bar.

## Viewing connection logs

Connections that are used for testing in the integration designer, and those assigned to deployed instances, create logs.
If a connection ever throw a connection error (for example, if the credentials in the connection have expired), you will see that in the connection's logs.

To view a connection's logs, click the log icon to the right of the connection.

You can click any log line in the popover that's comes up to get more information about that log line.

## What gets logged?

If a component invokes `context.logger.{debug,info,warn,error}()` within its code, that log line is saved in Builder's logging system.

In addition to logs issuing from components, you will see the following types of log lines in your logs:

| Type           | Example                             | Purpose                                                                                     | Log Level |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Instance Start | Starting Instance 'Sample Instance' | Indicates the beginning of a run of an instance.                                            | info      |
| Instance End   | Ending Instance 'Sample Instance'   | Indicates that an instance ran successfully to completion.                                  | info      |
| Step Started   | Fetch file from Dropbox             | Displays the name of the step that was invoked.                                             | info      |
| Step Failed    | {{ ERROR MESSAGE }}                 | Indicates that a step of an instance failed to run, and displays the related error message. | error     |
