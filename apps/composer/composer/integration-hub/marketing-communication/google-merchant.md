You can integrate Commerce with the Google Content API for Shopping using the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager. Once you have registered your Elastic Path Commmerce Cloud-powered storefront with the Google Merchant Center, you can use the integration to upload your products so that they automatically appear in Google Search results in the **Shopping** tab. When a search result is clicked, it links to your Commerce-powered storefront.

Whenever a catalog release is published in Commerce, the integration invokes the Google Content API for Shopping. The following data is displayed:

- Product name.
- Product description.
- Price.
- Image.
- Link to your product on your storefront.
- EAN/UPC.

The integration supports adding new products, updating existing products, and deleting products. 

:::caution

- All products default to an **in_stock** status in Google, regardless of their availability in Commerce.
- The integration does not support bundles.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the integration, there are some prequisites you need to meet in Google Merchant Center and Commerce.

### Prequisites in Google Merchant Center

You need to perform the following steps in Google Merchant Center before configuring the integration.

1. You must set up a Google Merchant account.
1. In the Google Merchant Center, you must verify ownership of your storefront. 
1. For products to be valid in Google, Google requires that you supply shipping details and prices, and a returns policy. The Google Merchant Center does not consider your products valid until this is done.
1. Once your Google Merchant account is set-up, you need to create an API authentication key for the Content API. The API key is some JSON data which you must save securely and not check-in to source control. You need the `client_email` and `private_key` from this JSON file when you configure the integration. 

    | Option | Description                            |
    |:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
    | **client_email**                    | The email address associated with your Google Merchant account. |
    | **private_key**                     | Your Google Merchant account private key. |
    | **google_merchant_id**              | Your Google Merchant account ID. |

For more information, see [Merchant Center - Google for Retail](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/merchant-center/).

### Prerequisites for Commerce

You need to perform the following steps in Commerce before configuring the integration.

1. Products that you want to synchronize with the Google Content API for Shopping must have a `EAN/UPC` attribute configured. Although this is an optional attribute for products in Commerce, Google analyses your product data for quality and may downrank your products in search results if your products do not have the `EAN/UPC` attribute configured.
1. You must have created your catalogs. See [create a catalog](pathname:///docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-catalog).
1. You must have collected the setup information from Commerce. You can find this information in Commerce Manager under **SYSTEM**, in **Application Keys**, when logged in as a user with Seller Admin privileges.

    | Option | Description                            |
    |:------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
    | **API Base URL**                    | Your Commerce API Base URL. For example, `https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/oauth/access_token`. See [Regions and URLs](pathname:///guides/Getting-Started/elastic-path-domains#regions-and-ur-ls). |
    | **Client ID**                       | Your Commerce Client ID. |
    | **Client Secret**                   | Your Commerce Client Secret. |

    :::note
    When integrating with third-party providers, we recommend you use the closest region in the third-party service to reduce latency as much as possible. See [Regions and URLs](pathname:///guides/Getting-Started/elastic-path-domains#regions-and-ur-ls).
