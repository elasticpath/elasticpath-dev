You can quickly and easily integrate Commerce with Segment using the **Integrations Hub**. 

Segment is a customer data platform that simplifies the process of collecting data and connecting to new tools. With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive your Commerce data, and send the data to your marketing, product, and analytics tools, including data warehouses. When there are customer or order changes in Commerce, Segment first processes the data, then translates and routes it to the destinations you have enabled in Segment.

The integration is responsible for server-side tracking, for example, order completion, updates, and cancellation events. Your business also requires a frontend component. For example, when customers view product details pages or when products are added to carts, you can integrate Segment Javascript in your frontend to track these events. See [Integrating Segment in Studio](pathname:///docs/studio/Integrations/Integrating-segment#using-the-segment-integration) for an example of using Segment in a storefront.

In other words, the integration enables you to track the stages of your customer's journey by integrating Commerce with Segment, using Commerce as the main source of information.

## Segment Integration Templates

The Segment Integration uses the following request templates that contain all parameters required for the Segment Integration to function correctly. The Segment Integration provides default templates. However, when configuring the integration, you can edit these templates to change or add any additional parameters that Segment provides, depending on your business requirements.

The templates use [JSONata](http://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html).

The following table describes the templates available.

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Checkout Started Template** | If **Enable Checkout Started Tracking** is selected, you can use this template to define the information to send to Segment. A sample template is available [here](https://try.jsonata.org/I7eKN4Wjn). |
