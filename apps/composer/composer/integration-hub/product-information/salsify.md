You can quickly and easily integrate Commerce with Salsify using the **Integrations Hub** in Commerce Manager. Integrating Salsify with Commerce means you can synchronize catalog data such as products, price, images, and categories between Commerce and Salsify.

:::note
When integrating with third-party providers, we recommend you use the closest region in the third-party service to reduce latency as much as possible. See [Regions and URLs table](pathname:///guides/Getting-Started/elastic-path-domains#regions-and-ur-ls).

### Prerequisites

 - Ensure that you have [collected your setup Information](#collecting-your-setup-information).
 - Ensure that you have created a [price book](pathname:///docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#creating-price-books), [hierarchies](pathname:///docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/hierarchies/creating_hierarchies), and [templates](pathname:///docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/extending-products/templates#creating-templates) in Commerce Manager.

 ### Procedure

1. In Commerce Manager, go to **COMPOSER > Integrations Hub**.
1. Under **Product Information**, click **Salsify**
1. Click **Configure**. The Salsify integration guides you through the steps you need to follow to complete the integration.
1. Click **Next**. The **Connection** page is displayed.
1. On the **Connection** page, do the following:
    1. Complete the **Commerce Connection** credential details:
        - **Client-ID**  - Your Commerce Client ID.
        - **Client-Secret** - Your Commerce Client Secret.
        - **Token URL** - Your Commerce API Token URL

    1. Click **Connect**. The authorization is successfully completed.
    1. Complete the **Salsify Connection** credentials:
        - **API Key** - Your Salsify API Key.
        - **Org Id** - Your Salsify Organization ID.
        - **API Base URL**  - Your Salsify API Base URL. Default value is `https://app.salsify.com/api/v1/orgs/`.

    You can use templates to send your custom data or attributes to another system using JSONata.
1. Click **Edit** under **ElasticPath Product Template**.
1. Update the **Product Template** to map the Commerce product templates and attributes to Salsify.
    
    For example, suppose you want to import Salsify field brand and Feature-2 attributes into commerce Manager. You need to update `templateSlug` and `fieldSlug` fields to represent attribute slug in Commerce.

    The following example shows how this should look in the Product Template.

    ```Json
    "attributes":[
    [
        {
            "templateSlug":"products(extension)",
            "templateAttributes":[
                [
                    $merge([
                        ($product.Brand ?
                            {
                                "fieldSlug":"brand",
                                "type":"string",
                                "value":$product.Brand
                            }
                        )
                    ]),
                    $merge([
                        ($product.'Feature-2' ?
                            {
                                "fieldSlug":"feature2",
                                "type":"string",
                                "value":$product.'Feature 2'
                            }
                        )
                    ])
                ]  ~> $filter(function($v, $i, $a) {
                    $v.value
                })
            ]
        }
    ]
    ] ~> $filter(function($v, $i, $a) {
        $count($v.templateAttributes) > 0
    })
    ``` 


1. Click **Edit** under **ElasticPath Price Template**. Update the price book name of Commerce in `priceBookName` field. For example, if the price book name is `UKandIEPricebook` in Commerce cloud, update the same in the **Price Template**.
    For example: 

    ```Json
    "priceBookName": "UKandIEPricebook"
    ```
1. Click **Edit** under **ElasticPath Node Template**. Update the name of the hierarchy created in Commerce in the `hierarchySlug` field.
    For example:

    ```Json
    "hierarchySlug": "uk-hierarchy"
    ```

1. Click **Next**. The **Configuration** page is displayed.
    
    **Enable Salsify to Elastic Path Sync**, **Enable Salsify Event - Product Creation**, and **Enable Salsify Event - Product Updates** are enabled by default to automatically synchronize from Salsify to Commerce.

1. (Optional) If you want to trigger full sync, turn on the **Enable Full Sync Scheduler** toggle. The full sync will be triggered as per the **Full Sync Cron Job Time**. By default it is disabled.
        :::note
