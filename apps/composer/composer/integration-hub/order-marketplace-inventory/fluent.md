You can quickly and easily integrate Commerce with Fluent Commerce using the **Integrations** hub in **Commerce Manager**. Integration with Fluent Commerce enables you to manage your orders for your business. Fluent Commerce also handles product inventory because it provides you a complete view of your stock, which can be published in all channels, including store front.

## How the Fluent Commerce Integration Works

This is how integration with Fluent Commerce works:

- Products are synched from Composable Commerce to Fluent Commerce.
- Customers are synched from Composable Commerce to Fluent Commerce.
- Orders are sent from Composable Commerce to Fluent Commerce – you can configure webhook events for the following Commerce event types:

    - `order.created`
    - `order.updated`
    - `order.fulfilled`
    - `order.paid`
    - `order.authorized`

    When you are integrating with Composable Commerce, you can setup webhook events for multiple scenarios, for example, you have triggered a webhook for the `order.paid` event – orders from Composable Commerce are sent to Fluent Commerce when the payment is processed.

- Orders are captured in Composable Commerce – after a payment for an order is authorized in Composable Commerce, the order details are sent to Fluent Commerce and the order items are allocated. You can trigger webhook event to capture the order in Composable Commerce.
- Orders can be marked as `paid` in Composable Commerce – you can trigger a webhook event to mark an order as paid when it is shipped to a customer. For more information, see [Mark Orders as Paid in Commerce Manager](/composer/integration-hub/order-marketplace-inventory/fluent#mark-orders-as-paid-in-commerce-manager).

If your integration is successful, you can view the new customer account details both in Composable Commerce and Fluent Commerce:

 - In Commerce Manager, under **Customers and Accounts**, click **Customers**.
 - In Fluent Commerce, under **Order Management**, click **Customer**.
