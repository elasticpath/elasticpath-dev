Unit testing is an incredibly important part of software development.
You want to catch errors and breaking changes before they wreak havoc on your customers' integrations.

By creating a series of unit tests for your custom components, your development team can feel comfortable updating custom component code without the risk of introducing regressions.
Plus, when you write unit tests you're creating sample use cases for your component, which yields documentation-as-code for your custom component.

Today let's work through adding unit tests to a sample custom component.

## Unit testing with Jest

There are numerous JavaScript testing frameworks available, but we'll use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for this tutorial.

## Add tests to the Hello Composer component

In the [Hello Composer](/composer/builder/getting-started/first-custom-component/hello-builder.mdx) tutorial, you build a custom component that takes a first name and last name as inputs, and returns a message that greets the user.
Let's verify that the component works as expected by adding unit tests.

1. First, create a test file by adding an `index.test.ts` file to the `src/` directory.
2. Next, import the testing harness from the Primsatic custom component SDK, create a test harness, and write a few test cases for the `myAction` action.

   ```ts title="index.test.ts"
   // Import the Composer custom component SDK testing harness
   import { createHarness } from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/testing";

   // Import your component from index.ts
   import myComponent from ".";

   // Create a new test harness
   const harness = createHarness(myComponent);

   // Test your component
   describe("Test the myAction action", () => {
     test("Test what happens if both first and last name are provided", async () => {
       // Invoke the action by name
       const result = await harness.action("myAction", {
         firstName: "John", // These keys should match the action's input keys
         lastName: "Doe",
       });
       // Declare your expectations - a unit test will fail if this expectation is not met
       expect(result?.data).toBe("Hello John Doe!");
     });

     test("Test what happens if first name is an empty string", async () => {
       const result = await harness.action("myAction", {
         firstName: "",
         lastName: "Doe",
       });

       expect(result?.data).toBe("Hello  Doe!");
     });
   });
   ```

   3. Finally, run your tests with `npm run test` and verify that your unit tests pass.

If your tests pass, you will see a set of green checkmarks in your terminal.

If someone from your team adjusts the `myAction` action to return a different message, your unit tests will fail and you'll know that you need to update your code, or update your integration.

## Test actions that require a connection

In the [Wrap an API in a Component](/composer/builder/custom-components/quickstarts/wrapping-an-api-in-a-component.mdx) tutorial, you build a custom component that wraps a mock API.
That component included a connection with an API key.

Let's look at two different ways to supply that connection to a unit test:

### Option 1 - Source the connection information from environment variables.

You can use the `process.env` object to access environment variables in your unit tests.
This is a great option if you want to run your unit tests in a CI/CD pipeline.

```ts title="index.test.ts"
import {
  createConnection,
  createHarness,
} from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/testing";
import myComponent from ".";
import { acmeErpConnection } from "./connections";

const harness = createHarness(myComponent);

// Create a connection to be used by the action test
const myConnection = createConnection(acmeErpConnection, {
  baseUrl: "https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data",
  apiKey: process.env.ACME_API_KEY, // Source the API key from an environment variable
});

describe("Test the get item by ID action", () => {
  test("Ensure the get item by ID action returns an item", async () => {
    const result = await harness.action("getItemById", {
      connection: myConnection,
      itemId: "1",
    });
    expect(result?.data).toEqual({
      id: 1,
      name: "Widgets",
      quantity: 20,
    });
  });
});
```

When running your test, you can supply an `ACME_API_KEY` environment variable by setting it in an `.env` file, by passing it in as a command line argument, or by `export`ing it in your terminal.

### Option 2 - Pull the connection information from an existing connection in Composer

Assuming you already have a valid connection in an existing Composer integration, you can instruct `prism` to fetch the connection's information from Composer and use it in your unit tests.
The connection that you fetch will be accesible from an environment variable named `PRISMATIC_CONNECTION_VALUE`.

Look at your browser's address bar when viewing your integration in Composer, and copy the `SW5....` portion of the URL.
That is your integration's ID.

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/unit-testing-custom-components/import-existing-connection.png"
  alt="Import an existing connection from Composer"
  maxWidth="800px"
/>

You can then print your connection's value to the console by running the following command:

```bash
prism components:dev:run \
  --integrationId SW50ZWdyYXRpb246YmU1N2NlYTgtYjQ4Ny00YWEzLTk0ZTktZDA4NmJiNmM2Yzdi \
  --connectionKey "Acme ERP Connection" -- printenv PRISMATIC_CONNECTION_VALUE | jq
```

You should see a JSON object that contains your connection's information.

<Screenshot
  filename="quickstarts/unit-testing-custom-components/print-connection-with-jq.png"
  alt="Import an existing connection from Composer"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>

That JSON string can be parsed and referenced in your unit test.
Or, the `harness.connectionValue` method will take care of parsing the JSON and returning a connection object that can be used in your unit test for you.

```ts title="index.test.ts with connection from Composer" {6}
import { createHarness } from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/testing";
import myComponent from ".";
import { acmeErpConnection } from "./connections";

const harness = createHarness(myComponent);
const myConnection = harness.connectionValue(acmeErpConnection);

describe("Test the get item by ID action", () => {
  test("Ensure the get item by ID action returns an item", async () => {
    const result = await harness.action("getItemById", {
      connection: myConnection,
      itemId: "1",
    });
    expect(result?.data).toEqual({
      id: 1,
      name: "Widgets",
      quantity: 20,
    });
  });
});
```

To invoke the unit test with the connection from Composer, run `prism components:dev:run` along with `npm run test`:

```bash
prism components:dev:run \
  --integrationId SW50ZWdyYXRpb246YmU1N2NlYTgtYjQ4Ny00YWEzLTk0ZTktZDA4NmJiNmM2Yzdi \
  --connectionKey "Acme ERP Connection" -- npm run test
```
