      "Algolia â€“ Full/Delta/Large Catalog Integration: Added three new flows to the integration and configured a webhook in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud to synchronize inventory when the corresponding option is enabled. This connects the stock_transaction.created event to the Single Entry Inventory UpdateObject to Algolia Direct flow. Depending on the configuration, the flow retrieves either available or total inventory and sends the data to all Algolia indexes. There is an option to skip object creation if they do not already exist in that particular index. In version 58, a third flow is introduced to cache Algolia Mapping, refreshing on an hourly by default. This eliminates the need to fetch the mapping with every stock update."
