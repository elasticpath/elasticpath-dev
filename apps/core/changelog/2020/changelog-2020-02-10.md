**Major** Added new promotion type which sets the maximum value of a promotion. Now you can create a promotion which limits the maximum value of a promotion when applying a promotion to a userâ€™s cart. For example, a promotion for 25% off can be limited to $50 off a carts total. After the $50 discount is reached, no further discount applies.
