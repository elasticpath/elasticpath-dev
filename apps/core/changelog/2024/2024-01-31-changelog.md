**MAJOR** Commerce Manager: We have introduced a new Integration Builder design. This enhanced Builder experience allows you to:

*   Build integrations faster and easier in a low-code environment.
*   Streamline designer canvas that optimizes space usage.
*   Add and configure integration steps with improved efficiency.
*   Navigate seamlessly with introduction of new panning and zooming features.

**MINOR** When automatically adding free gifts in the shoppers cart, you now have to ensure that the currency of automatically added gift items matches with the currency of the eligible items. Additionally, the free gift item must be within the same catalog as the eligible items. In case of a currency mismatch, the cart response includes an **error** section addressing the issue with free gift items.
