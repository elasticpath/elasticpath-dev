**MINOR** Variations and variation options are now exposed in the responses for the following endpoints:

- `Get a products` in the Shopper catalog API. See [Get a Product](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-by-context-product).
- `Get a Product` in the Products API. See [Get a Product](/docs/api/pxm/products/get-product).

This enables you to see the variation options a child product represents.
