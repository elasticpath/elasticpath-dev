**MINOR** In Product Experience Manager, we have removed the `manage_stock` field from the response for the `Get all Products in a shopper catalog` endpoint. This field is still displayed in legacy catalog responses. For more information, see [Get all Products in a Shopper Catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-by-context-all-products).
