**MAJOR** In Subscriptions, events are now observable. Events are actions that occur in Subscriptions such as a subscriber changing their address or a subscription changing from active to inactive. This enables you to integrate Subscriptions with external systems like enterprise resource planning, fulfilment and other systems. For more information, see **[Subscriptions API Documentation](https://elasticpath.apidocumentation.com/reference)**.
