**MINOR** The following endpoints now support beta filtering.

*   **[Get all price books](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/get-pricebooks)**
*   **[Get all prices in a price book](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/get-product-prices)**
*   **[Get all price modifiers](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/get-price-modifiers)**

Beta filtering uses a new syntax that is an evolution of the original syntax, allowing more characters and formats. For more information, see **[Beta filtering](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/guides/Getting-Started/filtering#beta-filtering)**.

**MINOR** We have improved the application of cart-level promotions to ensure accurate discount distributions, addressing issues where discounts were incorrectly redistributed in certain situations involving exclusions.
