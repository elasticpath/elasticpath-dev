**MINOR** You can now extend product prices by adding custom attributes to a product price. This enables you to optimize your pricing data, enhancing your ability to respond to market dynamics and customer preferences. For more information, see [Add a product price to a price book](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/create-product-price).

**MINOR** A new **Get all Prices** endpoint allows you to retrieve all prices for a product, irrespective of the different price books that include that product's price. For example, you can filter for all prices for a specified `sku`, or filter for all prices changed before or after a given date. This will retrieve prices from all price books. For more information, see [Get all product prices](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/get-prices).

**MINOR** Commerce Manager: A new and improved Bundle Builder is available. The new bundle builder features an upgraded visual design, making it easier to use and more intuitive, with a smoother interface that simplifies the bundle creation process. For more information, see [Creating Bundles](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/bundles/bundle-configuration).

**MINOR** Commerce Manager: Improved account search functionality to enable more effective filtering by name, legal name, registration ID, and external reference. For more information, see [Searching Accounts](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-manager/account-management/accounts#searching-accounts).
