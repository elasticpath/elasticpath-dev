**INTEGRATION HUB**: Released **Algolia - Full / Delta / Large Catalog** V68 (US) - V53 (EU): This new version adds concurrency checking to prevent catalogs from being published concurrently, which can cause issues if the same data is updated at the same time. For more information, see **[Integrating with Algolia](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/composer/integration-hub/site-search/algolia)**.
