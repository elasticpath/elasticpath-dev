**MINOR** We have added the capability to configure the storage of null values in Custom API Entries. For more information, see **[Null Values](https://beta.elasticpath.dev/docs/api/commerceextensions/custom-fields#null-values)**.

**MINOR** On October 18, 2022, we notified customers that the **bundle\_configuration** object was misspelled as **bundle\_configuation** in the cart, cart items, and order items, and has been deprecated. We recommend using **bundle\_configuration** to create bundle configurations.
