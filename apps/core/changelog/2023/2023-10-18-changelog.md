**MAJOR** Commerce Manager: When building your child products, you can now choose to exclude or include variation options. This is useful if you have a variation option that you do not sell. This makes managing and building your child products quick and easy. For more information, see **[Building Child Products](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/assign-variations-build-child-products#including-excluding-variation-options)**.
