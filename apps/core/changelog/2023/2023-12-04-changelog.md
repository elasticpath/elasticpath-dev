**MINOR** We have introduced a new optional field to the Orders API, known as **external\_ref**. This field is designed to store external references from other company systems, enhancing seamless integration between our platform and external entities. For more information, see **[Update an Order](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/orders/orders-api/update-an-order)**.

Additionally, in Commerce Manager, we have also introduced a new field called **External Reference ID,** both on the order page and when filtering an order**.** For more information, see **[Orders](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/orders/orders-cm)**.
