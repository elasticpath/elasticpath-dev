**MAJOR** Commerce Manager: You can now curate your products in your nodes products lists. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each node in a hierarchy, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. For more information, see **[Curating Products](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/curating-products)**.

**MINOR** Bug fix: Fixed a bug to stop building base products when the product is already part of a bundle.
