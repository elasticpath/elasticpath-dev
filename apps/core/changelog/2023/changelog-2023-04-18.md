Commerce Manager: You can now add AND/OR conditions on attributes and hierarchies or nodes to be included and excluded from a promotion based on multiple conditions at the same time. See Promotions.

**Major** As announced on February 1, 2023, we have now seamlessly migrated all the existing legacy keys to a corresponding Application Key. In Commerce Manager, the migrated keys will now appear on the SYSTEM > Application Keys page. For more information, see Application Keys.

**Minor** Commerce Manager: When you checkout a cart with bundle configuration including multiple options from each bundle component, you can now view all selected multiple options for each bundle component on the Order details page. For more information about bundle configuration, see PXM Bundles in Commerce Manager.
