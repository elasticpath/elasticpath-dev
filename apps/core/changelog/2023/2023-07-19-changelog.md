**MINOR** Commerce Manager: When creating parent/child nodes, you can now:

*   Add a **Weight** to determine the order that your nodes are displayed in your storefront.
*   Localize your node name and description.

For more information, see **[Products Hierarchy in Commerce Manager](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/hierarchies/hierarchy)**.

**MINOR** Bug fix: Fixed a bug where sale prices were not being reset for organization products.
