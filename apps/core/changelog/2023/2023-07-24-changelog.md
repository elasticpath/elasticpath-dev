**MAJOR** We have introduced the beta release for Shipping Groups. Now, you can easily organize and manage cart or order items into distinct shipping groups. This feature allows you to split shipping, enabling you to tailor shipping concepts to your eCommerce offerings based on your specific business requirements. For more information, see **[Shipping Groups](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/shipping-groups/Overview)**.

Additionally, we have updated the **Order** details page in Commerce Manager. You can now see the following information within a shipping group:

*   **Shipping Group ID**
*   **Shipping Details**
*   **Tracking**
*   **Delivery** **Instructions**

For more information, see **[Orders](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/orders/orders-cm)**.
