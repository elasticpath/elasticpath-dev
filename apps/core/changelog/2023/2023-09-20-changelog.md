**MAJOR** A new Price Book Import feature allows you to create and update price books and product prices in bulk, at both organization and store level. Rather than having to go to each price book and manually edit 50,000 prices, you can use Price Book Import to bulk update all your product prices at the same time, including setting different prices for different currencies. For more information, see **[Price Book Import](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/pricebooks/price-import/overview)**.
