**MINOR** We have introduced a new optional field called **external\_ref** to the **[Customers API](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-cloud/customer-management/customer-managment-api/customer-management-api-overview)**. This field is designed to store external references from other company systems, enhancing seamless integration between our platform and external entities.
