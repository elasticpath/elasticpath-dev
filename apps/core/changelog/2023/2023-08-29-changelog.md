**MINOR** Algolia â€“ Full/Delta/Large Catalog Integration: Updates to single products now check for catalog sync operations and delay the update until the other operations are completed. Additionally, fixed a bug for child products identification. For more information, **[see Integrating with Algolia](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/composer/integration-hub/site-search/algolia)**.
