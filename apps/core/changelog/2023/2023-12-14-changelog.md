**MAJOR** In Product Experience Manager, we have introduced a new product attribute called **Product Types**. This enables products to be categorized by type, for example, **standard**, **parent**, **child** and **bundle**. This is useful because it allows you to filter on the product types relevant to your business. Product types also allow you to segregate your catalogs, for example, by bundles or child products. To see the product types in your current catalogs, you must initiate a full catalog publish. To do this, modify your hierarchies or price books, for example, add a new hierarchy or price book to your catalog, then publish the catalog. (You can remove these once the full catalog publish has performed.) For more information, see **[Product Types](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products#product-types)**.
