**MINOR** Commerce Manager: A new **list** filter in **Products Experience Manager** > **Products** enables you filter to your product list for a list of attributes that you provide. For example, you can provide a list of product IDs so that only the products whose IDs you have listed are displayed in your product list. For more information, see **[Filtering Products](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/filter-products)**.
