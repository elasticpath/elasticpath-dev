**MAJOR** As announced on May 10, 2023, only Org Admins will now have the permission to create stores in their Organizations. This change provides a more centralized and secure approach to store management. To create a new store, log into Commerce Manager, and go to **Organizations** to access all your stores from a single location. See **[Creating a New Store in Organizations](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/organizations/organizations-in-commerce-manager/home-page#creating-a-new-store-in-organizations)**. For more information, refer to our **[blog post](https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/introducing-organizations)** or watch a **[quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_8_XMVOlGQ)**. To access your organization, contact our support team by submitting a **[support ticket](https://signin.elasticpath.com/app/global_redirect/0oartsctk19qeAbkp357/login)**.
