#### Overview

Several Shopify-specific improvements to the app as well as a number of bug fixes and tweaks.

#### Collections Admin Page

Similar to the product index page the collections index will help users see the collections that have synced with
Studio. This should help us debug sync issues and give users greater confidence in understanding what CX-Studio has
pulled in from Shopify.
