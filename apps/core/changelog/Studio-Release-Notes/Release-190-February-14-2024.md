#### Overview

Improvements towards a seamless integration with Elastic Path Composable Commerce and lots of bug fixes in this release.

#### Elastic Path Composable Commerce

The following new features have been introduced when integrating Elastic Path Composable Commerce with Studio.

#### Product bundles

With Elastic Path Composable Commerce, you can create and manage [bundles](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/bundles/bundle-configuration). A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising of one or more products that you want to sell together. Your product bundles are now available in your Studio storefronts. In other words, when you select a bundle product, all the products that make up that bundle are automatically displayed. Depending on how your bundle is configured, your shoppers can purchase the products in the bundle.

#### Promotion coupons

With Elastic Path Composable Commerce, you can create [promotions](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-standard/overview). You can now add your promotion coupons to a smart links menu. This enables you to create buttons that add your promotions to a cart and checkout.

#### Layout

In the page editor, you can now create links with link text, similar to the way you create an action with links.
