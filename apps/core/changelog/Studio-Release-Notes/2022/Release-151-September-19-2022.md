#### Overview

This release was a move back to our weekly release cadence and included a some UI improvements and bug fixes.

#### Banner Features

**Back to Shopify Button**

Previously we didn't have an easy way for our users to easily get back to Shopify from Unstack. The addition of this
button fixes this and provides an easy way for them to return to Shopify when they might need to.
