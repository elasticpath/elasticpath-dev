#### Overview

A small release with a handful of bug fixes and tweaks. Several new features in the works including *Component
Properties* which is a set of changes to the section/component experience which will help to reduce redundancies with
our current component experience. More on this when it's released in the coming weeks.

#### Banner Features

**Recategorized Components**

We spent some time reorganizing renaming components to make it easier to find what you are looking for in the component
selector. We also added thumbnails for some of the components that didn’t have them. There is more work to come on this
to make it even better, but it’s already easier to find some things.

**Template Updates**

We rolled out an update to allow our backend teams to more-easily launch the templates that they've been working on.
This includes changes to way we generate screenshots of these templates as well as the way that we add them to accounts.
