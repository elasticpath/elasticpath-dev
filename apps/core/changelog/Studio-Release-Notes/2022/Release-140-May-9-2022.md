#### Overview

Release 140 had a little bit of everything with improvements to
our [Klaviyo integration](https://support.unstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060834214), margin controls, better CSS
targeting, and app performance topping the list. We also managed to squash a bug where some users were getting multiple
new lead email notifications.

#### Banner Features

**Margin Controls**

We rolled out some changes to the style guide that allow you to adjust margins on headings and text. This should give
users greater control over how their site looks.

**Targeting Sections and Boxes with Custom Code**

We rolled out a number of changes to enable targeting of specific boxes or section with custom code. This will be
particularly helpful for any of our users who want to use custom CSS or custom JavaScript.

**App Performance**

We also rolled out a change in the way that the Unstack app loads our JavaScript packages. This should make it much
snappier when loading in the browser

**Fixed issue with multiple lead notification emails!**

A number of customers were reporting multiple notifications were being sent when forms were filled out. This was a
persistent issue over a couple of weeks so if you're reading this and you see the issue again please let us know!

**Media Upload Limit Changed to 50mb**

A welcome change for video and large images, weâ€™ve changed the upload limits to 50MB from 10MB.

**Klaviyo Integration Improvements**

We've added support for pushing events to Klaviyo for *Viewed Page*, *Viewed Product* and *Added Product to Cart.*
