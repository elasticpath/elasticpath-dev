**Major** When duplicating hierarchies using `Duplicate a Hierarchy` endpoint, you can now use the `include_products` attribute to specify whether you want products associated with the nodes in an existing hierarchy to be associated with the nodes in the duplicated hierarchy.  This is useful because you do not have to re-associate all your products with the duplicated hierarchy. For more information, see [Duplicate a Hierarchy](/docs/api/pxm/products/duplicate-hierarchy).
