**Minor** Improved validation when creating and updating integrations.

**Major** Added a new [`payload` field to webhooks](/docs/api/integrations/integrations-introduction#example-typical-payload) with the JSON representation of the updated object. _`resources` is now deprecated but remains in place for the foreseeable future._
