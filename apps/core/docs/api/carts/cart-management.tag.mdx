A Cart contains the product and custom cart items that a user intends to purchase. After a Cart is ready for Checkout, you can use the [Checkout endpoint](/docs/api/carts/checkout) to convert the cart to an order.

:::note

- Adding, modifying, or removing any cart items, custom items, or promotions always returns the cart meta, calculated using the calculation method. This is useful to update the client with up-to-date totals.
- We will automatically delete carts 7 days after they were last updated.
- If you do not pass a `X-MOLTIN-CURRENCY` header specifying what currency you would like the cart to use, the products in the cart are converted to your default currency.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
