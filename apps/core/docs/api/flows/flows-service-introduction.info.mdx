With flows, you can:
 
- in Commerce, define custom data fields for the resources that you use in your store or organization, such as adding more fields to the `customer` resource. You can also create new resources, such as a wishlist resource to support wishlists in your store. With flows, you can apply Composable Commerce to almost any use case. See [**Flows in Commerce Manager**](#flows-in-commerce).
- in Product Experience Manager, attach a specific set of attributes for your products. In Product Experience Manager, flows are called templates. See [**Templates in Product Experience Manager**](#templates-in-product-experience-manager).
 
You can create flows/templates at both organization and store level.

Custom names and values prefixed with $ are not supported.

### Flows in Commerce
 
You can define custom data fields for the resources that you use in your store or organization, such as adding more fields to the `customer` resource. You can also create new resources, such as a `wishlist` resource to support wishlists in your store. With flows, you can apply Composable Commerce to almost any use case.

:::caution
 
- In an organization, not all resources are available. See [**Extend a resource**](https://elasticpath.dev/guides/Custom%20Data/extend-any-resource) for a list of organization resources that can be extended.
- If you store any sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or non-public data on your site, ensure that you do not use this data in flows to avoid potential access to the data. For more information, see [**Permissions**](/docs/authentication/Tokens/permissions).

### Templates in Product Experience Manager
 
 Templates allow you to attach a specific set of attributes to your products.
 
 - You can use templates to define characteristics of your product, for example, a product specification. For example, a *Book* template might contain attributes, such as *ISBN*, *Author*, *Number of pages*, *Year Published*, or *Condition (New/Used)*.
 - You can use templates for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). When you assign template attributes such as, *care instructions* or *fabric*, to a shirt and a shopper searches for a specific item, attributes help stores to return the products that match the search criteria. For example, when a shopper searches for a large blue shirt, all shirts that are large and blue are returned in the search result.
