An `Account Member` resource is a user that you can add to accounts using account memberships.

Account members API is read only, and you cannot add users using this API. There is a 1 to 1 correspondence between User Authentication Info and an Account Member, the corresponding objects have the same id. You must use the `user_authentication_info` object to create users in the authentication realm of account authentication settings. For more information on adding account members, see the [Adding Accounts and Account Members](/guides/How-To/Accounts/add-account-and-member) section.
