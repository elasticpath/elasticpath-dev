Use the Administrator Latest Releases Catalog View API to retrieve product, hierarchy and node information.

:::danger

The Administrator Latest Releases Catalog View API is for Administrator use only. Do not use these endpoints on your customer-facing frontends.

:::

Publishing a catalog creates a release of that catalog that you can use in an organization or in a specific store or other shopper experience. You can retrieve the hierarchies, nodes, and the `live` products associated with a catalog release. You can see which parent nodes a product is associated with. This is useful if want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example.

Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current release.
