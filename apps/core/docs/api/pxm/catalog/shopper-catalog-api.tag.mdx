Use the Shopper Catalog View API to retrieve hierarchy, node and product information for a catalog release. When you publish a catalog for a store, you can define catalog rules so that you can show catalogs with different pricing or different products to preferred customers or channels. These endpoints can be used in your customer-facing frontends.

A catalog is a combination of one or more hierarchies, products, and a price book. Use the Products API and Hierarchies API to create a hierarchy of products that can be included in a catalog. Use the Price Book API to associate prices with products.

### Characteristics of Shopper Catalogs

Shopper catalogs can have the following characteristics.

- Use catalog rules to schedule a catalog to appear during a particular date and time, such as a seasonal catalog. The catalog may have different pricing than the other catalogs. You can have multiple published catalogs.
- If you have defined catalog rules and you want to retrieve a published catalog for a particular channel or a user-defined tag, you must set the appropriate headers in the request:
  - `EP-Channel` - The channel, such as website or mobile app. See [**Create a Catalog Rule**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-rule).
  - `EP-Context-Tag` - A tag defined in the store, such as `clearance`. See [**Create a Catalog Rule**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-rule).
* When a catalog is ready to be used in a store, you publish it. See [**Publish a Catalog**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).
* You can create and publish catalogs for different contexts and channels. You can see the differences between the last 2 consecutive catalog releases. See [**Publish a Catalog**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).
* You retrieve catalogs for your shopper experience by using the Shopper Catalog View API. For more information on how you can retrieve a catalog as a shopper using the Catalog API.
* When a catalog is published for a store, the corresponding events contain `store_id` and `org_id`. 
* When a catalog is published for an organization, the corresponding events contain `org_id`. 
* Use the `sort_order` value in `variations` to program your storefront to display the variation options in the order that you want.

### Shopper Catalog Caching

When conducting a `GET` on `catalog` endpoints, all data returned, including catalog releases, products, nodes and hierarchies, are cached for 5 minutes. This means, if you call the same endpoint again, the catalog data is retrieved from the cached objects pool, optimizing the performance and efficiency of your store front.

If you use any of the `catalog` endpoints with a `filter` or `include` query parameter, these are cached separately. 

The cached entries disappear from the cached objects pool after 5 minutes.
