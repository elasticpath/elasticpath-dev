The Inventory API allows you to manage stock for products at both organization and store levels. Each product keeps a history of inventory transactions, enabling easier stock auditing.

You can specify an initial stock level when you create a product. The stock is set to `0` by default.

:::caution 

You cannot create multiple inventories of the same organization-level product in different stores because no unique stock ID, specific to each store, is currently generated. Hence, when you try to manage inventory of the same product for different stores, you get an invalid product identifier error.
