### Characteristics of Exporting Products

- Product exports are an asynchronous operation. When you send a request to the Export API, it triggers an asynchronous job to build the `.csv` file containing the product entries.
- Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send product export requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed. See [**Jobs**](/docs/api/pxm/products/jobs).
- The Export API response includes a job resource. In the response, you can verify the job status; if the status is successful, the response includes a link to the location where the `.csv` file is stored. See [**Product Export CSV File**](#product-export-csv-file). A single CSV file contains 10,000 rows, excluding the header. If you are exporting 50,000 products, the job endpoint response contains links to five `.csv` files; each `.csv` file including 10,000 products.
- You might have specified custom extension data in a `.csv` file when you imported the products. These modifications are all exported. So, when you send a request to the Export API, the `.csv` file, included in the Job endpoint response, reflects any changes that you have made.
- You cannot export product bundles.

### Product Export CSV File

The Product Export API generates a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file that you can use to import/update products, main image files, and custom extension data. 

The `.csv` file is:

 - Comma-separated.
 - Header-based.
   - Header attributes must be the same as the product attributes.
   - Header names can be in any order.
 - Each row after the first line represents a single product.

The following table describes the headers that are supported.

| Header                           | Required | Description |

| id                               | Optional | A unique product ID that is generated when you create the product. The `id` is used to look up products in the `.csv` file and matches them to the products in your storefront that you want to update.                                                    |

| description                      | Required | A description for a product. You can include quotes in your product description, if you want to emphasize a word, for example. To do this, put quotes around the product description. For example, "This product description describes my "product" and the product "version"." |
| slug                             | Required | A label for the product that is used in the URL paths. A slug can contain any combination of letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores.

| `template:<flowID>:<fieldName>`  | Optional | Custom extension data includes the flow `ID` or `slug` and the field `name`. See [Exporting Custom Data (Flows)](#exporting-custom-data-flows).   |                                                                                                              

### Exporting Main Image Files

The main images that you have previously uploaded Commerce are exported. A `main_image_id` header is added to your `.csv` file. The ID in `main_image_id` is the ID of a file that has already been uploaded to Commerce using [create a file](/docs/api/pxm/files/create-a-file).

### Exporting Custom Data (Flows)

Custom extension data is exported in a `.csv` file by creating a header that includes the flow `ID` or `slug` and the field `name` as shown below:

- `template:<flowSlug>:<fieldName>`
- `template:<flowID>:<fieldName>`

where:

- `template` must be `template`.
- one of the following for the template that contains the field whose data you want to export:
  - `flowID` is the ID of the flow.
  - `flowSlug` is the flow slug.
- `fieldName` is the name of the field whose data you want to export.

In the following example, for a flow with ID `82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b` and a field with the name `condition`:

- the header is `template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition`.
- the updated custom data is `as-new`.

| name | slug | sku | status | template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BestEver Range | bestever-range-1a1a-30 | BE-Range-1a1a-30 | draft | as-new |
