#### Creating Dynamic Bundles: An Overview

The following steps are an overview of how to use dynamic bundles.

1. Create your products using [**create a product**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
1. Create a bundle using [**create a bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
1. Specify minimum and/or maximum values for the number of product options that can be selected within the bundle. For example, if you want the shopper to select exactly 4 out of 10 options, set both the minimum and maximum values to 4 for each of the 10 product options.
1. For each product option in the bundle, specify if it is a default option by adding `"default": true` to the product options that you want to be pre-selected for the shopper.
1. Publish the bundle to your catalog using the [Publish a catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release) endpoint so you can display the products to your shoppers in your storefront.
1. When a shopper interacts with the bundle on your storefront, they can select the products they want from the list of options. Use the [configure a shopper bundle](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/configure-by-context-product) endpoint to capture the shoppers selections. This updates the `bundle_configuration` with the product options chosen by a shopper.
1. Once a shopper has configured their bundle, use the add a product to a cart endpoint to add the selected bundle to the shopperâ€™s cart.
1. When the shopper proceeds to checkout, the selected product options from the bundle are included in the order.

### Bundles of Bundles

#### Creating bundles of bundles: an overview

To create a bundle of bundles, simply add a bundle as a component to another bundle.

1. Create your products using [**create a product**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
1. Create all your child bundles using [**create a bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
1. [**Create a parent bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product) and specify the product ID of your child bundle as an option of a component in your bundle. You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle.
