#### Using Imported Main Image Files

You can use the main images that you have previously uploaded to Commerce and assign them to your products when importing products to Commerce. You can do this by adding a `main_image_id` header to your `.csv` file. The ID you provide in `main_image_id` is the ID of a file that has already been uploaded to Commerce using create a file.

#### Importing Custom Data (Flows)

You can also create/update custom extension data in a `.csv` file by creating a header that includes the flow `ID` and the field `slug` in the following format: 

template:*flowID*:*fieldSlug*.

where:

- `template` must be `template`.
- `flowID` is the ID of the flow that contains the field whose data you want to create/update.
- `fieldSlug` is the slug of the field whose data you want to create/update.

In the following example, for a flow with ID `82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b` and a field with the slug `condition`:

- the header is `template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition`.
- the updated custom data is `as-new`.

    | name | slug | sku | status | template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | BestEver Range | bestever-range-1a1a-30 | BE-Range-1a1a-30 | draft | as-new |

#### Characteristics of CSV Import Files

Product Import uses a [**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**](#characteristics-of-csv-import-files) file to import/update products, main image files, and custom extension data. 

- Each row in a `.csv` file represents a product you want to create/update. 
- Each file:
    - must not be larger than 50 megabytes. If a `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, a `503 client read error` is displayed.
    - must not have more than 50,000 rows, including the header. If a CSV file exceeds 50,000 rows, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported.
    In other words, if you have a file with 50,000 rows that is larger than 50 megabytes, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported.
- If you want to create/update more than 50,000 products or your `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, you must have a separate `.csv` file and import each `.csv` file one at a time.
- You can update existing products, including images, templates/flow fields, and entries. The entry in the `.csv` file must have a unique `id` and/or `external_ref` that matches the `id` and `external_ref` of the existing product you want to update. You may have both a unique `id` and `external_ref`, but you must have at least one.
- You can add new products. For new products that you want to add, the entry in the `.csv` file must have an `external_ref` that does not match any existing products.

The following table describes the headers that are supported.

| Header | Required | Description  |
|:---- |:---------|:--|
| id                              | Optional | A unique product ID that is generated when you create the product. The `id` is used to look up products in the `.csv` file and matches them to the products in your storefront that you want to update.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
