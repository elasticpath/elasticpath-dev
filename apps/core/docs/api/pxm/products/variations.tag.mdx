### Sorting the Order of Variations and Options

The `variation_matrix` object lists the variation IDs and variation option IDs and their corresponding product IDs that are generated when the variation and variation options are built with a product. The `variation_matrix` can then be added to your catalogs.

The order of the variations in the `variation_matrix` is the order of the variations in the array when the variations were linked to the product. For example, the first variation in the `variation_matrix` corresponds to the first variation in the array, and so on. You can use the `sort_order`attribute to sort the order of your variation and variation options in the `variation_matrix` object. The sort order value is visible when you add the variations and variation options to your catalogs. You can then use the `sort_order` value to program your storefront to display the variations and variation options in the order that you want.

Add the `sort_order` attribute to the body of your request and specify a `sort_order` value. A `sort_order` value must be a number. You can specify any numbers that you want.

- 1, 2, 3, or 100, 90, 80, and so on.
- Zero or negative numbers.

You can set `sort_order` to either `null` or omit it entirely from the request if you wish to remove an existing `sort_order` attribute.

:::caution

- Commerce does not sort variations and variation options. You must program your storefront to sort the variations and variation options in the order that you want.
- You must rebuild your products for the sort order changes to take effect. See [**Build Child Products**](#build-child-products).
