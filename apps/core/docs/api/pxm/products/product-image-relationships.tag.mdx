Products are the items or services that you might want to sell in your store. In Product Experience Manager, products can also have associated rich media assets, such as product images or a file containing additional product details.

You can do this using [Files API](/docs/api/pxm/files).

Once you have created your files, you associate files with your products using the [Create Product Main Image Relationships API](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product-main-image-relationships).




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
