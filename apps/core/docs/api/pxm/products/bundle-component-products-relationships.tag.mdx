With Product Experience Manager, you can create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising of one or more products that you want to sell together.

You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component must have at least one or more options. Each option is a product and a quantity.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
