Products are the items or services that you might want to sell in your store. In Product Experience Manager, products can also have associated rich media assets, such as product images or a file containing additional product details. You can do this using the Files API.

 Once you have created your files, you associate the files with your products using the [Create Product-File Relationships API](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product-file-relationships).
