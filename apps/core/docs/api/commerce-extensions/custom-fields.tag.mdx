A Custom Field represents a single field of data (for example a Product Rating). A Custom API is composed of one or more Custom Fields.

Here is a comparison of different types and validation available in Custom APIs vs Non-Core Flows.

| Feature                           | Non-Core Flows   | Commerce Extensions                        |

## Validation

When [creating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field#request) or [updating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field#request) a Custom Field, `validation` can be used to limit the values that may be stored in the corresponding Custom API Entry.

:::note

All validation changes, such as those to `allow_null_values` and any type specific rules, apply to new entries only. Existing Custom API Entry records are unaffected until updated.

:::

### Integer Validation
- `min_value`: Specifies the minimum whole number that can be stored. If set, it must be less than `max_value`.
- `max_value`: Specifies the maximum whole number that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than `min_value`.

sample integer validation object:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "integer": {
      "min_value": 0,
      "max_value": 32
    }
  }
}
```
Even if no validation is set, field_type `integer` only supports values between -2^53+1 and 2^53+1. This is because the JSON format doesn't guarantee that values outside this range are portable ([Source](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159#section-6)). 



### Float Validation
- `min_value`: Specifies the minimum number that can be stored. If set, it must be less than `max_value`.
- `max_value`: Specifies the maximum number that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than `min_value`.

sample float validation object:

```json 
{
  "validation": {
    "float": {
      "min_value": 0.01,
      "max_value": 32.01
    }
  }
}
```

The `float` field_type cannot accurately represent some numbers and so using very small or large numbers might lose precision. We recommend that API clients use either the `integer` field_type if applicable , or the `string` data type if perfect precision or recall is required.

### String Validation
- `min_length`: Specifies the minimum number of characters that can be stored. If set, it must be less than 0 and less than `max_length`.
- `max_length`: Specifies the maximum number of characters that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than 0 and `min_length`.
- `regex`: [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regular expression that used to restrict the specific characters that can be stored. This must be less than 1024 characters.
- `unique`: Specifies whether the field can have unique constraint or not. It must be `yes` or `no`.

sample string validation object:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "string": {
      "min_length": 0,
      "max_length": 64,
      "regex": "^.+\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|pdf)$",
      "unique": "yes"
    }
  }
}
```
Even if no validation is set, field_type `string` only supports values that are up to `65535` characters long.


### Null Values

All Custom Fields can be configured to restrict the storage of `null` values for that field on a Custom API Entry. By default, this is `true`.

sample validation object :
  
```json
{
  "validation": {
    "boolean": {
      "allow_null_values": false
    }
  }
}
  ```

## Reserved Slugs

The following values cannot be used as a `slug` in a Custom Field.

- slug
- type
- id
- meta
- created_at
- updated_at
- links
- relationships
- attributes
- attribute
- dimension
- dimensions
- weight
- weights
