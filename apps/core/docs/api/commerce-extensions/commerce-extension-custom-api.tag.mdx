A **Commerce Extension Custom API** is the resulting API that gets created as a result of the Custom API, Custom Field.

## Events

You can integrate Commerce Extensions with your external systems by observing the appropriate events. For more information, see [Integrations](/docs/api/integrations/integrations-introduction).

Given you have a Custom API with `api_type` of `wishlist_ext` and you want to perform additional processing when an action is taken, like when a wishlist is created:

```bash
curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/extensions/wishlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d $ {
    "data": {
      "type": "wishlist_ext",
      "name": "My Wishlist",
      "items_count": 0,
      "keep_purchased": false
    }
  }
```

When you [create an integration](/docs/api/integrations/create-integration) with `wishlist_ext.created` in `observes` field.
Then the configured `webhook` or `aws_sqs` will receive the appropriate message.

You can configure integrations to observe the following events for your Custom API Entries:
* Created
* Updated
* Deleted
