Jobs have the following characteristics:

  - Jobs are asynchronous.
  - This process is repeated until all jobs are processed.
  - Jobs have a different status, depending on where a job is in its lifecycle.
  - Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send requests using endpoints that function as jobs, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date.
  - Jobs include the data used when an endpoint is run.
  - Jobs report messages and/or errors to help you understand the reasons for any failed jobs.
    
### Job Lifecycle
    
A job can have the following status:

- PENDING - Commerce has received the request but is currently busy processing other requests.
- STARTED - Commerce has started processing the job.
- SUCCESS - The job has successfully completed.
- FAILED - The job has failed.
