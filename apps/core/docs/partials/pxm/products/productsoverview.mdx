Products are the items or services that you might want to sell in your store. In Product Experience Manager, a product has a name, description, ID, and SKU. Products can also have additional attributes and associated rich media assets, such as product images or a file containing additional product details. If your store supports multiple languages, you can localize product names and descriptions.

Product data is stored in a database. After you add products, you can update product information, add images and other assets, and associate products with one or more hierarchy nodes. You can export the updated product information back to other business systems so that your organization sees a consistent view of products.

While defining products, the products are in a draft state. Your organization can develop the criteria and business processes to help determine when a product is ready to go live and appear in a catalog.

To appear in a catalog, a product must meet the following criteria:

- The product is live.
- The product is associated with at least one hierarchy.
- The catalog references a hierarchy that includes the product.
