With Product Experience Manager, you can use the products API to create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising of one or more products that you want to sell together.

You can use bundles in different ways. For example, a consumer electronics and video game company, *Playtend Games* can sell a *Playtend* video game console as a bundle that includes the console, controller, and game. The price of the bundle might be different from the total of the individual products.

Alternatively, you may have a fixed, marketable banner product featuring only one item, such as a 'product of the week.' In this use case, the banner bundle description remains constant, while the product within the bundle can be easily swapped in and out.

You must not assign a product to a bundle if the product is in draft status as this invalidates the bundle.

You can have:

- Dynamic bundles. Dynamic bundles allow your shoppers to choose their own options in a bundle.
- Bundles of bundles. Your bundle consists of child bundles.
