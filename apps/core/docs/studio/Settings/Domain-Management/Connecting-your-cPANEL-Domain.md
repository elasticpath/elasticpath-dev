Follow the below steps to connect a domain hosted on **cPANEL** to your Studio
account. [Here is a link to their official documentation](https://docs.cpanel.net/).

1. Head to Zone Editor in your cPanel account, which you will find in the Domains section of the cPanel Home page.
2. In the Zone Editor, it is easy to add, remove, and edit records for domains hosted on the server.
3. Find the zone you would like to change, and click on *Manage*.
4. Under actions, click on the type of record you would like to add and copy and paste over the values from your Studio
   domain settings.

:::note
Keep in mind that it may take up to 48 hours for Studio to reflect the changes you've made in cPANEL.
