## What happens to my removed domain?

Your domain will no longer be recognized within Studio. Therefore, even if you leave in the previously correct DNS
setup, it will not point to your website. Only custom domains that are setup within your Studio settings are recognized
and correctly point to your Studio site all others will be rejected.

## How do I setup a new domain?

See [Setting Up Custom Domain](/docs/studio/Settings/Domain-Management/Setting-up-your-Custom-Domain).
