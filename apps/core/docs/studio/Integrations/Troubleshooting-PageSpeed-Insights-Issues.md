## What is PageSpeed Insights?

*PageSpeed Insights* is a tool developed by Google to analyze the content of a selected web page, and generate
suggestions to make that page faster.

    [Go to PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

## Applying Recommendations

When it comes to acting on the recommendations of *PageSpeed Insights* there are certain things that we can help you
with, and there are certain things that we're unable to help with.

As an example, looking to the *Opportunities* section in the report you may see a recommendation to "*Serve images in
next-gen formats*". This is a great example of something we ***can*** help with as we
offer [several different image optimization options for you to utilize](/docs/studio/content/Media-Management/Understanding-Image-Optimization-Settings).

However, an example of a recommendation we ***cannot*** help you with would be "*Reduce unused JavaScript*", especially
if that recommendation references a third party app such as HubSpot, Mailchimp, Intercom, etc.

## 3rd Party Integrations, Google Tag Manager, and PageSpeed Insights

In some cases, loading your 3rd party integrations through a *Google Tag Manager (GTM)* container can help to
dramatically improve the results you get from *PageSpeed Insights*. For more on this we highly recommend that you check
out [this article from *Analytics
Mania*](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/google-tag-manager-impact-on-page-speed-and-how-to-improve/) that dives deep
into the options, when doing so is beneficial, and when it's not.
