## Adding a collaborator to Studio

If you want to grant Studio access to someone who doesn't have access to Shopify, you'll first need to add them as a
collaborator by having them request collaborator
access. [This process is outlined here](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/request-access).

If a user on your Shopify store wants access to Studio, you'll need to first ensure that they have permission to do so
in Shopify. This is managed via the following path in Shopify:

1. Settings
2. Users and permissions
3. *[Select the User]*
4. Permissions
5. Apps and Channels

Once you've confirmed that the Shopify user can access *Studio Page Builder,* that user just needs to select open the
Studio app. This will automatically add them as a user to your Studio account and will allow them to create pages just
as you are able to.
