Building an ecommerce page with Studio has never been easier. As long as your Shopify account has been connected to
Studio and your [products have been synced](/docs/studio/Shopify/Syncing-your-Shopify-Products-Where-are-my-products) it's as easy as adding a form to a page, or a header to a section.

## Add a Product component

On the product page you'd like to create, add a **Product** component. These are components that are specifically designed
to handle/display your Shopify products.

### Choose a product

Once you've added a **Product** component to the page, you'll need to select a product to display. Click into the
component, and select a product from the sidebar by searching or scrolling. It's important to note that all the product
metadata pulls in from Shopify. This means that if you need to make a change to the product information, then you'll
need to make that change in Shopify.

## Not seeing any products?

Make sure Shopify is connected properly and that you
have [created your products in Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/add-update-products). Still having
issues? Make sure that Shopify and Studio
are [synced properly](/docs/studio/Shopify/Syncing-your-Shopify-Products-Where-are-my-products).

If you've chosen the wrong product, all you need to do is to click into the component again and select the **X** next to
the component to remove it.
