Studio enables you to customize your site's appearance.

If you need a way to add custom code to _every page_, custom integrations are the way to go.&#x20;

Custom integrations can be used to:

* **Tweak global CSS** for things not customizable in the Style guide
* **Add additional scripts** for analytics or functionality
* **Add a global banner** at the top or bottom of the page
* And more...

A custom integration can be inserted before or after the content of the page, or in the `<head>` of the HTML. See [Custom Integrations](/docs/studio/Integrations/Adding-HTML-CSS-or-JavaScript-to-all-your-pages).
