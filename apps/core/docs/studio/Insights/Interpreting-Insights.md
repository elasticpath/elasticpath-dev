## Overview

"Insights" is what we call the section in Studio where you can review the various metrics & data-points collected on
your site. There are also four tabulated sections for further insights: **Activity**, **Test Results**, **Conversions**,
and **UTMs**.

## Traffic

This is made up of two sections: **Traffic** which will provide an overview of how your site is doing and **Engagement**
which will show you how your pages are performing.

The graph depicting site performance is broken down by three specific metrics: Page Views, Uniques, and Sessions.

![Traffic Metrics](/assets/studio/Traffic_1.png)

- **Page Views**: Times a page is viewed by a user.
- **Uniques**: Number of unique users.
- **Sessions**: Interactions one user takes within 4-hour time frame.

  You can toggle through 90-days, 30-days, and 7-days to see how your traffic has changed over time.

- **Engagement**: A list of all your pages, their view count, unique, and average time on page.

  ![Engaging Content](/assets/studio/Engagement_1.png)

- **Page**: Title of page.
- **Page Views**: Times the page is loaded and viewed by a user.
- **Uniques**: Number of different IPs that visited a page.
- **Average time on page**: Average time a user spent on this page.

  Below is an example of sorting by descending and ascending for different data points.

- **A/B Test**: An overview of your A/B tests, where they were done, how they're doing, and what the end result was.

  ![A/B Tests](/assets/studio/A_B_Test_1.png)

- Page: Hyperlinked name of the page test is running on.
- Test: Name of the test assigned when setting it up.
- Status: Whether the test is active (running) or ended (concluded).
- Started: Date this test began.
- Ended: Date the test ended.
- Variants: In-depth view into different variants of test and they're performance.

## Variants

- Name: Which variant this is: control (unedited) or variant (edited).
- Uniques: How many visitors viewed this variant.
- Conversions: Times visitors have submitted a form from this variant.
- Conversion Rate: Conversions divided by Uniques to see the percent of visitors who convert.
- Winner: Whether or not this was the winning variant.

## Conversions

A representation of the path your visitors go on before converting.

See screenshots below for examples:

![Conversion Paths](/assets/studio/Getting_Started_Unstack_Insights__6_.png)

This is going over the source someone came from and the pages they viewed before converting via a form submission.

Like engagement, you can toggle to sort visits and conversions numbers.

New from conversion paths you can toggle between conversion paths for organic traffic and paid.

## Sources

An overview of where your site traffic is coming from and the revenue/lead attribution as provided by Studio CRM and
Stripe integration.

This is the same for all other units (i.e., source and page)

- Source: Where the traffic came from.
- Uniques: Number of unique users from that source.
- Sessions: How many sessions source produced.
- Pageviews: How many page views source produced.
- Avg. time: Average amount of time a user from that source spent on the page
- Leads: Attributed leads from that source (click view to see them).
- Conversion rate: Percentage of users who converted via a form.
- Bounce rate: Percentage of users that leave without converting.
- Revenue: Amount that source has generated (from Stripe integration).
- Rev/click: Total revenue divided by the number of Uniques.
