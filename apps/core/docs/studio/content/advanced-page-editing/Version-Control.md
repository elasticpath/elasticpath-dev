## Before we begin

If you restore a previous version without publishing your current edits, your current progress will not be saved as a
version, it will be lost. To save your current progress, publish the page or article before restoring a previous
version.

Every time you "publish" a page or article, we save the changes you've made to that page as a "version". It is possible
to view a history of these *versions* by simply:

1. Opening the settings for a page (or article).
2. Selecting *Versions* from the top right of the settings drawer.

3. From here, you're able to *Preview* previous versions of the page or article and even *Restore* them if need be.
