## How does it work?

Through Studio you can enable a "table of contents" within
your [Blog Settings](/docs/studio/content/Blog-Management) to provide readers with a short list of
navigation items to help them quickly navigate through your articles. Once enabled, you'll see your table of contents in
your article as long as there are multiple text items is styled as **H2**'s in the article body.

## Side Note

Enabling this will also move the social share icons that are auto-added to your article to the top-left of your article;
right above your table of contents.
