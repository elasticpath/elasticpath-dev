## Supported Video Embeds

At the moment Studio supports embedded videos from a couple different third party platforms; including Youtube, Vimeo,
and Wistia.

## Website/Landing Pages

1. To add an embedded video to a website page or landing page, you'll first need to find the video you'd like to add.
2. Once you've identified the video you'd like to add, you'll need to add a media section to your page. This can be any
   section with a media object. For this example we've chosen the standard section: *Media/Text*.

3. Next we'll add the video. Click into the media object in your section and select the *embed* option from the side
   menu; this is where you paste in your video URL.

4. Click the **+** button in that field to save the entry, and boom! Your video has now been embedded.

## Blog Posts/Articles

Unlike with the standard page editor, the article editor doesn't support the addition of sections. This means that the
adding of videos is handled differently than it is above.

1. To embed a video in an article, you'll first need to open the editor and start a new line by hitting ***return*** or
   ***enter***.

2. Once you're on the new (empty) line, you should see a **(+)** button appear; click it.

3. Upon clicking this button you'll see a couple more options presented to you. The 3rd option is the one you'll need to
   select.

4. After clicking that video option you'll be asked for a URL; paste it here and hit ***return/enter*** to save your
   changes. You video should now appear in-line in your article.
