- **Autoplay if allowed**: Enabling this auto-plays the video if the browser your users are using will allow it. For
  example, [here is a link to Google Chrome's policy.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/)

- **Loop Video**: Enabling this option forces your video to loop back to the beginning as soon as it completes.
- **Mute**: Enabling this option will prevent your video from having any sound at the beginning of its playback. This is
  a
  crucial
  setting to enable if you want your video to autoplay.
- **Show Controls**: Enabling this option shows the options for pausing, playing, or full-screening the video that we're
  all
  familiar with.
