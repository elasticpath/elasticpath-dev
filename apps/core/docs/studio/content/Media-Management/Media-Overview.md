## Overview

When you upload images, icons, or videos the files are automatically added to your Media library. Once they're a part of
this library, they can be used repeatedly through your site without having to upload the file more than once.

## Uploading files

There are a couple ways you can upload these files:

1. Upload direct to your Media folder by accessing the "Media" tab, click on **[+]** to select a file to upload.
2. Upload when you're in the page editor. Add a media section, click the empty image container and upload the media file
   like explained above.

### Uploading PDF files

Like images, PDFs can be uploaded direct to your Media folder by accessing the "Media" tab.

### Alt text

Alt text is a short text description that helps blind or visually-impaired visitors understand an image on a page.

Open the media window and add your alt text to the field shown below.

If you are receiving any errors or have any issues uploading a particular image or video, this could be because it does
not meet specific requirements. Your image or video must be under **50MB** and fit the supported file types listed
below:
