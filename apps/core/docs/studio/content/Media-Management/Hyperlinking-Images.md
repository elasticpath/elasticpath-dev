Hyperlinking an image will make it so when the visitor clicks the image it'll open the link within the same tab as the
page they're currently viewing.

## Hyperlinking an image already on the page/article

1. Click the image to expand the media modal
2. Once the media modal is expanded within the "Link to" field you may enter the full URL or resource title
   using [smart linking](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Smart-Links).

## Hyperlinking a new image

While selecting the image from the media modal, type your URL or smart linked page title into the "Link to" field
then click save.
