## What is background media?

Previously it was just background images, however, after the introduction of Studio native video hosting, we renamed
this to background media due to the various options of what can be a background.

## Adding or swapping background media

When the background media icon is white and you click it, the media modal will open. Within the media modal, you can
either upload an image, upload a video, or find and use an image from Unsplash.

## Swapping

When swapping you'll click the blue media icon within the main toolbar, then in the sub-toolbar that appears, click the
swap button, then upload or find the media you'd like to use.
