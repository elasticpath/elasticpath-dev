The below guide is intended to walk you through the basics of building landing pages in Studio.

1. Create a new page

   To start, you'll need to first create a new page. This is done by clicking **+New Page** in the top-right of **Landing Pages**.

2. Choose a template

   Next you'll be prompted to select a template as the foundation of your page. If you don't want to start with a template, click on the **Blank Page** card.

3. Choose a product

   Studio for Shopify

   This step only applies to accounts using Studio for Shopify. If you're using Studio for Websites this does not apply to you.

   If a template was selected in the last step, you'll now be asked to select a product. Two things to note:

   * Selecting a product here does not prevent you from changing the product later.
   * You do not have to select a product here. Click **Skip step** in the top right to skip this step. Not seeing the product you're looking for? See [Syncing your Shopify Products](/docs/studio/Shopify/Syncing-your-Shopify-Products-Where-are-my-products).

4. Modify/Add Content

   At this point your page has been created and it's time for you to make it yours. If you haven't already, confirm that
   your [styles are set up properly](/docs/studio/design/Design-&-Styles/Using-your-Style-Guide) and then have a read
   through some of our other documentation to familiarize yourself with things like
   the [basics of page structure](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Understanding-page-structure), [linking to pages/products](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Smart-Links),
   and [more](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/).

5. Advanced Customization

   Spend some time learning about some of the more advanced page-editing features available to you in Studio. Things
   like:

    - [A/B Testing](/docs/studio/Insights/Setting-up-an-AB-Test)
    - [Mobile Editing](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/Managing-Device-Visibility)
    - [Conditional Content](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/Using-Conditional-Content)
    - [Dynamic Text Content](/docs/studio/content/advanced-page-editing/Using-Dynamic-Text-Content)

6. Final Check & Publish

   All set? Page looking good? Great! Last step here is
   to [confirm your page settings](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Page-Settings). There's not much to them, but it's still good to review to make sure everything is in order.

   Things still looking good? [Mash that publish button](/docs/studio/content/Basic-Page-Editing/Publishing)!
   Your page is done!
