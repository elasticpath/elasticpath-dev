There are three different ways to list text-based content in Studio. Though before you can take advantage of this
feature, you'll first need to enter the list of text items in a text block in the Studio editor.

Once added to the text block, highlight your text and select one of the below three options:

- Checklist
- Unordered List
- Ordered List

Want to adjust how these lists look? Head over to the Style Guide and scroll down to the "Lists" section.
