## When are we online?

Studio Support is online at 9:00am EST to 5:00pm EST every Monday through Friday. However, there may be times where our
team is not online during this period (Holidays, Company Meetings, etc.). When this happens we'll do our best to
communicate this to you!

While we are here to help however we can, there are certainly some things that fall outside the technical scope of our
team. So, below is the full explanation of what and when we can lend a helping hand for you and your team.

## What can we help with?

### Studio Features

Anything we built, we support. However, if your team built it or customized it beyond our app's features (for example, added
CSS/JS), we cannot help you with that. Instead, we provide some resources to get you on the right path.

### Web Hosting and Performance

We're here to help you with the process of DNS, site load, and all other outlets of web hosting which occur and are
originated within the Studio platform.

###Integrations

If an integration is listed on our integrations page, we can help. However, we cannot login nor troubleshoot your account.

## Limited Support

Our support team cannot provide aid on the following topics.

- Custom Code: We cannot be responsible for providing, editing, reviewing, or helping with custom code even if it's in
  relation to a custom component. We can only ensure the code we publicly provide is in working order.
- SEO Optimization: We help with SEO in [many ways natively](https://www.unstack.com/blog/unstack-website-seo). Outside
  of these, we cannot help you with SEO, SEO best practices, or SEO strategy.
- Custom Integrations: If an integration is listed on our integrations page, we can help. However, if you injected a
  custom integration using our custom integration option, we cannot help with the validation or support of that integration.
