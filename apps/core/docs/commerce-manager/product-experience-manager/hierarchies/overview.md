A hierarchy is a tree structure that consists of a root node with one or more parent nodes. Each parent node can also have one or more children nodes, and so on, creating a parent-child relationship between nodes.

A product can belong to multiple nodes in multiple hierarchies. When you create a catalog, you specify one or more hierarchies. Any products associated with those hierarchies are included in the catalog. 

If your store supports multiple languages, you can localize new and existing hierarchies and nodes.

The following example of *Elpa basketball shoe for men* shows different hierarchies and nodes that the product might be in:

- Brands > **Elpa**
- Shoppers > **Men**
- Shoes > Sports > **Basketball**

The root of a hierarchy specifies the aspect of the product data that the hierarchy displays. For example, root can be categories, brands, types, or manufacturers of the products. You cannot assign products to a root node.

A node in a hierarchy contains products grouped in a specific theme, such as a products from a specific brand.

## Localizing Hierarchies

You can localize your hierarchies. If your store supports multiple languages, you can localize hierarchy names and descriptions. Commerce supports all languages in [Unicode 14.0 Character Code Charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/index.html).

## Sorting Node Order 

You can sort the order of your nodes, regardless of where the nodes are in the hierarchy. Enter a value to determine the order that nodes are displayed in your storefront. The node with the highest value is displayed first. The weight value must be greater than or equal to one. For example, 1, 2, 3, or 100, 90, 80, and so on.
