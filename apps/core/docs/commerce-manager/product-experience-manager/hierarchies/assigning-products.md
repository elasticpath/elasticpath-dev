You can assign products to hierarchies and their child nodes. This determines how the products are displayed in the shopping catalog of your storefront. For example, a Nike basketball shoe for men can be assigned to the following hierarchies and nodes:

- Brands > **Nike**
- Shoppers > **Men**
- Footwear > Sports > **Basketball**

1. Go to **Product Experience Manager** > **Configurations**.
1. Select the **Hierarchies** tab.
1. Select the hierarchy that contains the nodes whose products you want to assign. 
1. Select **Nodes**.
1. Navigate to the node to which you want to add products. If there are no nodes created for this hierarchy, you must create them before you can assign any products.
