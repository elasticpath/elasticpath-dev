When you delete a catalog, the catalog configuration and all its releases are deleted. The hierarchies, products, and price books remain in the database. If the catalog is associated with any catalog rules, you must first update the catalog rules to remove the catalog.

- To delete a catalog, in the **Product Experience Manager > Catalogs** page, click **...** next to the catalog you want to delete and click **Delete**.
- To delete more than one catalog, select the checkbox beside the catalogs that you want to delete and click **Actions > Delete**.
