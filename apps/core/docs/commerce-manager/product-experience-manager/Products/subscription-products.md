Elastic Path Subscriptions allows you to offer your customers subscriptions and recurring billing for your products and services. Elastic Path Subscriptions gives you the flexibility to pause, update, or reactivate your subscription offerings, change subscription cycles and apply discounts.

You can build subscription offerings with products created in Product Experience Manager. Product Experience Manager manages product information, hierarchies, and price books. Ideally, Product Experience Manager becomes the single source of truth for product data across your organization.

## Prerequisites

You must create all of your currencies in your store. See [Manage Currencies](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/currencies/manage-currencies).
