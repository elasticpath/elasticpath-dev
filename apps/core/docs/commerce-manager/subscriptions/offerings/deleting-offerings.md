When a subscription is created, it creates a snapshot of the offering. This means you can delete an offering without affecting any active subscriptions.

1. Select **Subscriptions** > **Offerings**. The **Subscription Offerings** page displays all the offerings that you have created.
2. Either:

   - Select **...** next to any offering that you want to remove, and then select **Delete**.
   - Select the checkbox on an offering that you want to remove and then select **Actions** > **Delete**.

3.Select **Delete** to delete the plan and close the confirmation dialog.
