The Subscriptions API is set of APIs used to manage subscriptions. Learn how to use the Subscriptions API to manage your subscriptions. 

:::note
This guide uses the command line to make requests via cURL, but you can also use a supported SDK.
:::

## Objectives

The following steps describe how to manage subscriptions using the Subscriptions API.

1. Create a product. The products and services are what you want to offer in a subscription.
2. Create plans. Plans are the rules that govern your subscription, for example, delivery frequency, the quantity and any discount. You can combine and reuse plans for as many products as you want, making it quick and easy to create your subscription offerings.
3. Create an offering. Offerings are the products and plans that a customer can choose. An offering can consist of many combinations of products or plans, depending on the products and services you offer.

## Creating a Product

You can create the products and services that you want to offer in a subscription. Products can have additional attributes, such as price, and rich media assets, such as images or files containing additional product details.

The following request creates a **4K Streaming** product, including a description and a SKU.

```bash
curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/subscriptions/products \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
    "data": {
       "type": "subscription-product",
       "attributes": {
       "name": "4K Streaming",
       "description": "What is 4K Streaming? Its the highest resolution available, giving excellent picture quality and crisp, clear details. 4K Streaming elevates your viewing experience to the next level.",
       "sku": "77012025"
       }
     }
 }'  
```

The response contains the subscription product.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "attributes": {
            "created_at": "2023-11-28T14:13:56.219902965Z",
            "description": "What is 4K Streaming? It's the highest resolution available, giving excellent picture quality and crisp, clear details. 4K Streaming elevates your viewing experience to the next level.",
            "name": "4K Streaming",
            "sku": "77012025",
            "updated_at": "2023-11-28T14:13:56.219902965Z"
        },
        "id": "cc04b3a7-602d-4aeb-bcf1-f7254fefae61",
        "meta": {
            "owner": "store"
        },
        "type": "subscription-product"
    }
}
```

For more information about product media and pricing, see [Repeat Products](/docs/api/subscriptions/products).

## Creating Plans

You can use plans to model your subscription. Plans are a set of rules and conditions that manage the provision of repeat products in an offering. You can combine and reuse plans for as many products as you want, making it quick and easy to create your subscription offerings.

The following request creates the **Standard with Adverts** plan.

- The billing cycle is monthly and customers are billed on the 1st of the month.
- The plan length is 12 months and rolling. In other words, customers pay regularly and repeatedly, until the plan is cancelled.
- the plan has a fixed price.

```bash
curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/subscriptions/plans \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{

        "USD": {
