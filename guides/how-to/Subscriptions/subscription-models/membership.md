Whenever your business charges a recurring fee for access to some or all of its services or products, or set of privileges, you are providing a membership experience.

The benefit of this type of subscription is that it is simple and straightforward. Membership subscriptions do not offer a steady stream of fresh products and services, but allow you to provide certain benefits to members. For example, members discounts, free next-day delivery, loyalty points, access to premium content, and so on.

## Characteristics of Membership Subscriptions

Using the membership model, you can:

- offer a trial period.
- set weekly, monthly, and yearly billing cycles.
- discount products for subscriptions
- set different prices for the same products
- set separate pricing according to each:

    - product
    - plan/billing cycle
