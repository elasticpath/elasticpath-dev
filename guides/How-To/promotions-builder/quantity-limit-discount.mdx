**Use Case:** You want to encourage shoppers purchase two of the same items, by offering a 50% discount on one of them.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. Specify the required quantity of SKUs that need to be purchased as part of the condition. This can be done by configuring the **items quantity** parameter in [Create Cart Condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-condition).
2. Configure a [Cart Item condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition) to target the desired item.
3. Create a [BXGY discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-bxgy-promotion) in the **Actions** section for a 50% discount with a maximum quantity limit for the discount to apply to.

By implementing this promotion, shoppers could be encouraged to purchase two of the same items, with one item being discounted by 50%.
