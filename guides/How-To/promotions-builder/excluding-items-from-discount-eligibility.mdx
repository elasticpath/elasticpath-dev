**Use Case:** You want to create a promotion where certain products are excluded from making the cart eligible for a discount.

In this scenario, you can set a condition to exclude specific products, categories, or products with certain attributes from making the promotion eligible for a discount. For example, if shoppers buy any product in the *Fashion Rings Jewellery* category, they will receive 20% off one of the cheapest items. However, if the excluded item, such as the *Platinum Flower ring*, is the only item in the cart, the discount will not be triggered.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. **Add a condition**: Select the eligible category for the promotion condition, such as the *Fashion Rings Jewellery* category, to determine which products should be considered for the discount.
1. **Add exclusion**: Specify the specific products, categories, or attributes that should be excluded from making the cart eligible for a discount. For example, exclude the *Platinum Flower ring*.
1. **Set up the promotion**: Specify the discount details, such as the percentage off and applicable products or categories in the **Actions** section. See [Creating Actions](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-actions).
