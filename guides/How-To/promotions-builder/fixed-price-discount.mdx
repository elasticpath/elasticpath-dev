**Use Case:** You want to offer a discounted price for a particular product using the promotion code, rather than discounting the price for all shoppers in Price Books.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. Specify the cart item to target the specific product. To do this, see [Cart Item condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition).
2. Create an [Item Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-an-item-discount-promotion) in the **Actions** section and choose **a fixed price**.
3. Specify the quantity required to avail the discounted price for the item.

By implementing this, shoppers can use a promotion code to purchase the product at a reduced price, offering targeted discounts without affecting all shoppers in Price Books.
