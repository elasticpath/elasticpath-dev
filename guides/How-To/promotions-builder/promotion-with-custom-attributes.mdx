**USe Case:** You want to offer registered shoppers a 20% discount when they purchase products made of platinum metal.

The system checks if the shopper is registered and if the product they added is made of platinum.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:
1. Create a [Cart Custom attribute](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#adding-cart-custom-attributes) that determines if your shoppers are registered when shopping. Set this value as **true** for anyone who has signed up for an account.
2. Configure a [Cart Items condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition) to check for the product attribute as metal type, and specify that the discount applies to product with the value as *platinum*.
3. Set up an [Item Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-an-item-discount-promotion) in the **Actions** section as 20% off.
