**Use Case:** You want to offer a First-Time Shopper Promotion to attract new shoppers to your store. 
This promotion can be customized with various discount types and rules, but a common approach is to offer a 10% discount on their first order.

This promotion requires the creation of a public coupon code. You can configure the code so that it is only applicable to shoppers who do not have any prior paid order history in their account. See [Create a Single Code](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-promotion-codes#creating-a-single-code).

**Key Conditions**:

- The shopper must have an account with no previous paid orders.
- The promotion is valid only for their first completed order.
