Let's say you want to create a promotion where specific products are excluded from both making the cart eligible for a discount 
and from receiving the discount themselves.

In this scenario, if shoppers buy any product from the *Fashion Rings* category, they can receive a 20% discount on other 
products from the *Fashion Rings Jewellery* category. However, products with the attribute *Platinum Metal Type* are excluded. 
This means these products will not make the cart eligible for the discount, nor will they receive the discount if they are included in the cart.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. **Add a condition and exclusions**: Select the eligible category for the promotion condition, such as the *Fashion Rings* category, to define which products can qualify for the discount, and specify any products or attributes to be excluded from the promotion. For example, exclude products with the *Platinum Metal Type* attribute to ensure they do not make the cart eligible for a discount.
1. **Configure the action and exclusions**: Configure a BXGY promotion in the **Actions** section to offer 20% off products in the *Fashion Rings Jewellery* category. After configuring the action, add exclusions to ensure that products with the *Platinum Metal Type* attribute are also excluded from receiving the discount. See [Creating a BXGY Promotion](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-bxgy-promotion).
