**USe Case:** You want to offer 20% off to all shoppers who spend $3000 or more on engagement rings. 
Additionally, shoppers also receive a 10% discount on the cheapest item from the *Bangles* category.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. Configure a [Cart condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-condition) to check if the subtotal is equal to or greater than $3000.
2. Add a [Cart Items condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition) specifying the engagement rings category.
3. Set up an [Cart Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-discount-promotion) in the **Actions** section for 20% off on engagement rings.
4. Configure [BXGY](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-bxgy-promotion) and create another item discount to apply a 10% discount on the cheapest item from the *Bangles* category.
