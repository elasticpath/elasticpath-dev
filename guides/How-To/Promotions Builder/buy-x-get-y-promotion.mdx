Let's consider a scenario where you want to offer a discount on silver jewelery for shoppers who buy gift cards for the holidays.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. Configure a [Cart Items condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-items-condition), and select **Product** option and add the eligible gift card items.
2. Create a [BXGY](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-bxgy-promotion) promotion in the **Actions** section. Configure an item discount for 70% off on all products with the *jewellery-metal-type* template, which contains *metal-type* with values as *silver*.
