**Use Case:** You want to create custom messaging for your promotion to make promotion restriction rules and conditions visible in your storefront.

In this scenario, you'll create a custom flow and corresponding fields to be visible when you create a new promotion using the Promotions Builder.

To set this up, you'll first need to create your flow, then enter the messaging content in your promotion.

### Creating the Flow

1. **Create a Flow**: Follow the steps to [create a flow](docs/commerce-manager/flows/flows.mdx) and create a new flow for your promotion rule messaging.
2. **Enter Slug**: In the `slug` field for your flow settings, enter **rule-promotions**. This step is important as it allows your flow fields to appear in your promotion configuration area.
3. **Enable your Flow**: After you add a **description**, check the **Enabled** checkbox to activate your flow, then click **Save**.
4. **Add Fields to the Flow**:
    - Select the flow from the list to open its details.
    - Click **+New Field** to add fields necessary for your promotion rule messaging, such as eligibility requirements, shipping restrictions, exclusions, or usage limits.
    - Choose the appropriate Field Type (e.g., String for message content).
    - Configure field settings, including name, slug, description, whether it is required, and any default values or validation rules.

After configuring each field, click **Save** to add it to the flow.

### Adding Messaging to a Promotion in Promotion Builder

1. **Create a Promotion**: Follow the steps for creating a new promotion in the Promotions Builder. For this example, we'll create a [Buy X, Get Y](guides/How-To/Promotions Builder/buy-x-get-y-promotion.mdx) promotion.
2. **Save your Promotion**: Once all promotion details, conditions, and actions have been added, **save** your promotion. For this example, we configure that a cart must contain a product from both the "Moisturizer" and "Cleanser" hierarchy nodes and set up a **Buy X, Get Y** action where the shopper gets 50% off the cheapest treatment added to their cart.
3. **Expand the Custom Fields**: To add your promotion rule messaging, expand the **Custom Fields** box to view the flow you have just created.
4. **Enter Promotion Rule Messaging**: Add your messaging in the corresponding string field, then save your promotion.
