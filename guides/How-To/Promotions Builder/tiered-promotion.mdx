**Use Case:** You want to provide shoppers with various cart subtotal tiers to receive different discounts. Shoppers need one coupon code to trigger the various tiers. For example, use the coupon code *summer2024*.

The shoppers need to:
- Spend equal to or less than $100 and get 10% off the cart subtotal.
- Spend between $100 and $500 and get 20% off the cart subtotal.

To set this up in the Promotions Builder:

1. Configure the first promotion for the $100 tier:
    1. Add a [Cart condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-condition) to check if the subtotal is less than $100.
    1. Set up a [Cart Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-discount-promotion) for 10% off the cart subtotal.
    1. Use the coupon code *summer2024* to trigger this promotion.

1. Configure the second promotion for the $100 to $500 tier:
    1. Add a [Cart condition](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-condition) to check if the subtotal is greater than $100 and less than or equal to $500.
    1. Set up a [Cart Discount](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#creating-a-cart-discount-promotion) for 20% off the cart subtotal.
    1. Again, use the coupon code *summer2024* to trigger this promotion.
