This walkthrough shows you how to integrate Apple Pay into an existing iOS app. After you integrate with Apple Pay, end users can pay for an order on their iPhones.

## Prerequisites

If you want to follow along, you need the following items:

- An Apple Developer account.
- A Composable Commerce account with an existing project. At minimum, you need:
    - Configured products
    - Configured payment gateway (manual)

## Step-by-step walkthrough

Feel free to skip to the end, and grab the completed example project by clicking the source code links under Further Reading, or follow the step-by-step walkthrough.

1. Get the code from GitHub.
2. Set up the iOS app project.
3. Display a product.
4. Update your store.
5. Set up Apple Pay credentials.
6. Set up an Apple Pay project.
7. Add an Apple Pay button.
8. Create an Apple Pay request.
9. Handle shipping.
10. Implement Apple Pay delegates.
11. Create a checkout in Composable Commerce.
12. Create payment transactions.

### Get the code from GitHub

In a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moltin-examples/applepay-starter.git
```

Then navigate into the new directory, and install the CocoPods:

```sh
pod install
```

### Set up the iOS app project

Open the workspace project in Xcode, and run to confirm everything is working.

![Open the workspace project.](/assets/apple-swift-1.png)

### Display a product

The app as it stands is a simple Master/Detail application that shows a list of products from a demo store in the master view. Tap on any product to navigate to a detail view which shows a bigger picture of the swag as well as a more detailed description.

### Update your store

Update the store ID in `MoltinProductsViewController` to use your products:

```javascript
//Replace with your client id
let moltin = Moltin(withClientID: "u8cV0fAtS8ELXcyxWY2r4deLTHs1i3NkgV8rt7ZqWX")
```

### Set up Apple Pay credentials

1. Log in to your developer account.
2. Go to **Member Center**, and click **Certificates, Identifiers & Profilesstrong\Identifiers\App IDs**.
3. Click the **+** button to create a new App ID.
4. Name the Apple ID with either your app name or use **Apple MoltinProducts**, and give it a Bundle ID in the format: `com.YOURDOMAIN.MoltinProducts`. If you already have a project, substitute the names accordingly.
5. Make sure that **Explicit App ID** is selected, as wildcard App IDs aren’t able to make payments with Apple Pay.
6. Under **App Services**, enable the **Apple Pay** checkbox, click **Continue**, and then click **Submit** to complete the creation of your new App ID.
7. Under **Identifiers**, click **Merchant IDs** in the left navigation pane.
8. Click **+** to create a new merchant ID, and use whatever description and merchant identifier you’d like. Generally, it’s recommended to create merchant identifiers in the reverse domain style that start with `merchant`, similar to bundle IDs.
9. Click **Continue**, and then click **Register** to create your new merchant ID.

Now that your App ID and merchant ID are set up, head back to Xcode to get your project ready for Apple Pay.

### Set up Apple Pay project

1. Select the **MoltinProducts** project in the left navigation bar, then select the **MoltinProducts** target, and change the **Bundle Identifier** to match the one you created previously.
2. Ensure that the **Team** selection box is pointing to the development team under which you created your App ID and merchant ID.
3. Click the **Capabilities** tab, expand the **Apple Pay** section, and ensure that the switch on the right is set to **ON**.
4. Push the **refresh** button below the merchant ID list. You should see the list populates with the merchant ID you added on the developer portal, if it wasn’t there already.
5. Make sure that your **merchant ID** checkbox is selected.

:::caution

At this point, you should have checkmarks next to all sections that deal with setting up a project, displaying a product, and setting up Apple Pay credentials. If any of the sections is not marked as checked, retrace your steps and correct the details to make sure you’ve satisfied Apple’s requirements.

:::

You now have Apple Pay enabled in your app.

### Add Apple Pay button

Open **Main.storyboard** and take a look at the **Buy Product** scene.

![Add a pay button.](/assets/apple-swift-2.png)

Apple has a very specific set of Apple Pay guidelines to adhere to, which extends to the buttons in your app. Take a few minutes to review these guidelines at the [Apple Pay developer site](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/).

The Apple Pay Buttons and Resources link at the Apple Pay developer site provides you with a zip file. The file contains an extensive collection of approved button resources for Apple Pay.

You can find a set of Apple Pay images ready for use in the starter project’s **Image.xcassets**.

Using the **Buy Product Interface Builder**, select the **Apple Pay** button, and change the image to **ApplePay**. Give your button an empty title instead of the default “button” title. Your scene should now look as follows:

![Add a button name and image.](/assets/apple-swift-3.png)

### Create Apple Pay request

1. Open BuyProductViewController.swift and add the following import to the top of the file:

    ```sh
    import PassKit
    ```

2. Locate `applePayPressed(sender:);` you execute this when the user attempts to purchase an item. To do this, you’ll need to create a `PKPaymentRequest` and a `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController`.
3. Locate `applePayPressed(sender:);` you execute this when the user attempts to purchase an item. To do this, you’ll need to create a `PKPaymentRequest` and a `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController`.
4. Add the following code to the body of `applePayPressed(sender:)`:

    ```javascript
    // TODO: - Fill in implementation
    let request = PKPaymentRequest()
    let applePayController = PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController(paymentRequest: request)
    self.present(applePayController!, animated: true, completion: nil)
    ```

5. Add the following code just under the IBOutlet properties of `BuySwagViewController`:

    ```javascript
    let SupportedPaymentNetworks =[PKPaymentNetwork.visa, PKPaymentNetwork.masterCard, PKPaymentNetwork.amex]
    // Add in any extra support payments.
    let ApplePayMerchantID = "merchant.com.YOURDOMAIN.ApplePayMoltin"
    // Fill in your merchant ID here!
    ```

6. In the viewDidLoad, check to see if the user can use Apple Pay.

    ```javascript
    applePayButton.hidden = !PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController.canMakePaymentsUsingNetworks(SupportedPaymentNetworks)
    ```

7. Now start filling out the request in `applePayPressed(sender:)`, under the `let request = PKPaymentRequest()`.

    ```javascript
    request.merchantIdentifier = ApplePayMerchantID
    request.supportedNetworks = SupportedPaymentNetworks
    request.merchantCapabilities = PKMerchantCapability.capability3DS
    request.countryCode = "US"
    request.currencyCode = "USD"
    ```

8. Create an array of `PKPaymentSummaryItem` objects that provide the user with a breakdown the items they’re purchasing. We add more detail to this array in the next step.

    ```javascript
    //Item information formatting
    let productToBuy = PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: product?.name ?? "", amount: NSDecimalNumber(decimal:Decimal((self.product?.meta.displayPrice?.withoutTax.amount)!/100)), type: .final)
    let total = PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Total with Tax", amount: NSDecimalNumber(decimal:Decimal((self.product?.meta.displayPrice?.withTax.amount)!/100)))
    //PKPaymentSummaryItem Array, we are adding too.
    request.paymentSummaryItems = [productToBuy,total]
    ```

9. Run the app to confirm whether you see Apple Pay when you hit the Apple Pay button on the buy scene.

![Verify that you can see Apple Pay.](/assets/apple-swift-4.png)

### Handle shipping

We add a static billing amount to start. Billing needs are going to differ greatly on what your store is selling.

```javascript
let shippingPrice: NSDecimalNumber = NSDecimalNumber(string: "5.0")
let shipping = PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Shipping", amount: shippingPrice)
let totalPrice = PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Total amount", amount: NSDecimalNumber(decimal:Decimal((self.product?.meta.displayPrice?.withTax.amount)!)/100).adding(shippingPrice))

//PKPaymentSummaryItem Array
request.paymentSummaryItems = [productToBuy,shipping, totalPrice]
```

### Implement Apple Pay delegates

In `BuyProductViewController.swift`, add the following extension to `BuyProductViewController` that implements `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate`:

```javascript
//Bottom of file
extension BuyProductViewController: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate {
    func paymentAuthorizationViewController(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController, didAuthorizePayment payment: PKPayment, completion: @escaping ((PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus) -> Void)) {
        completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus.success)
    }

    func paymentAuthorizationViewControllerDidFinish(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController) {
        controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

To be able to use the Apple pay, delegate class you need to set in `aboveBuyProductViewController` class. In the `applePayPressed(sender:)`, set it up using the following code.

```javascript
applePayController?.delegate = self
```

### Create checkout in Composable Commerce

In `BuyProductViewControllerin` the `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate`, you are sending a successful Apple pay order to Composable Commerce.

1. Get customers information. It is returned from the `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` in the `payment` object.
2. Set up `customer`.

    ```javascript
    let customer = Customer(withEmail: payment.billingContact?.emailAddress, withName: payment.shippingContact?.name?.familyName)
    ```

3. Set up the customer `address`. Note that shipping and billing addresses can vary.

    ```javascript
    let address = Address(withFirstName: (payment.shippingContact?.name?.givenName)!, withLastName: payment.shippingContact?.name?.familyName ?? "")
    address.line1 = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.street
    address.county = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.city
    address.country = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.country
    address.postcode = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.postalCode
    ```

4. Process an order with Composable Commerce.

    ```javascript
    self.moltin.cart.checkout(cart: AppDelegate.cartID, withCustomer: customer, withBillingAddress: address, withShippingAddress: address)
        { (result) in
        switch result {
                case .success(let order):
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    print(order)
                    }
                default: break
                }
        }
    ```

### Create payment transactions

Paying for the order can be done by various payment gateways. In this example we use the manual payment type, which allows you to complete the transaction that handles the payment processing any way you want.

1. In Commerce Manager, enable manual checkout. In Gateways, click **Enable** within the manual gateway and the click **Save**.

    ```javascript
    let paymentMethod = ManuallyAuthorizePayment()
    self.moltin.cart.pay(forOrderID: order?.id ?? "", withPaymentMethod: paymentMethod) { (result) in
        switch result {
        case .success(let status):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                print("Paid for order: \(status)")
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Could not pay for order: \(error)")
        }
    }
    ```

2. Within the checkout specified previously, complete the transaction by adding the following:

    ```javascript
    let paymentMethod = ManuallyAuthorizePayment()
        self.moltin.cart.pay(forOrderID: order.id, withPaymentMethod: paymentMethod) { (result) in
            switch result {
                case .success(let status):
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
                        print("Paid for order: \(status)")
                    }
                case .failure(let error):
                    controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
                    print("Could not pay for order: \(error)")
                    }
        }
    ```

3. Your `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` should now look like the following:

    ```javascript
    extension BuyProductViewController: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate
    {

        func paymentAuthorizationViewController(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController, didAuthorizePayment payment: PKPayment, completion: @escaping
        ((PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus) -> Void))
        {
            completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus.success)
            ///Customer
            let customer = Customer(withEmail: payment.billingContact?.emailAddress, withName: payment.shippingContact?.name?.familyName)

            //Address
            let address = Address(withFirstName: (payment.shippingContact?.name?.givenName)!, withLastName: payment.shippingContact?.name?.familyName ?? "")
            address.line1 = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.street
            address.county = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.city
            address.country = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.country
            address.postcode = payment.shippingContact?.postalAddress?.postalCode

            self.moltin.cart.checkout(cart: AppDelegate.cartID, withCustomer: customer, withBillingAddress: address, withShippingAddress: address)
            { (result) in
                switch result {
                case .success(let order):
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        let paymentMethod = ManuallyAuthorizePayment()
                        self.moltin.cart.pay(forOrderID: order.id, withPaymentMethod: paymentMethod) { (result) in
                            switch result {
                                case .success(let status):
                                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                                        print("Paid for order: \(status)")
                                        controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)

                                    }
                                case .failure(let error):
                                    print("Could not pay for order: \(error)")
                                    controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        default: break
                    }
                }
            }

        func paymentAuthorizationViewControllerDidFinish(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController)
        {
            controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)

        }
    }
    ```

## Moving forward

If you’d like to read more in-depth information about Apple Pay, you can check out their developer site. The site also has a list of other payment platforms, other than Stripe, that support Apple Pay.

There are many other features of Apple Pay that you could challenge yourself to add to your app:

- Calculate sales tax on the server and update the tax amount in `summaryItems`.
- Change the available shipping methods based on the ZIP code.
- Read the order information on the server, and verify that the address is valid as a shipping destination.
- Create your own customized Apple Pay button by following the Apple Pay guidelines.
