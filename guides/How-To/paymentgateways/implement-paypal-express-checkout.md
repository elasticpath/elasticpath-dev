Implement PayPal Express checkout to authorize, capture, purchase, and refund payments.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have a Commerce account, and Client ID and Client Secret of your store available from [Commerce Manager](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/commerce-manager/application-keys/application-keys-cm).
- Get An [access token](/guides/Getting-Started/your-first-api-request).
- Create an account in [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/).
- Configure products and gateway using Commerce Manager or API.
- Onboard PayPal Express Checkout. See [Onboarding PayPal Express Checkout](/docs/commerce-manager/payments/paypal).

## Procedure - Set up the Checkout Flow

Use the API to create a checkout flow. At minimum, you need the ability to setup and confirm the purchase and authorization workflow.

### `Purchase` workflow

You can use any URL safe value you want for your cart IDs. If a cart does not already exist with that ID, it will be created the first time you add an item. If the request is successful, you will get a `201` response with all of the cart items that exist in the updated cart.

You can set up and confirm a purchase by doing the following:

1. Checkout using a customer object. For more information, see [Checkout](/docs/carts-orders/account-checkout).

    :::caution
    Ensure that you use a valid country code. The URL used in this call is `http://localhost/v2/carts/{{cartID}}/checkout`.
    :::

1. Use the following request example to set up `purchase` from PayPal Express Checkout gateway. For more information, see [PayPal Express Checkout Payments](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/api/carts/authorize-setup).

    ```bash
        curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/orders/:orderId/payments \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
            -d $'{
	           "data" : {
		       "gateway" : "paypal_express_checkout",
		       "method" : "purchase",
		       "options" : {
                   "description": "Test description",
                   "soft_descriptor": "integration test",
                   "application_context": {
                       "brand_name": "TEST brand",
                       "locale": "en-US",
                       "landing_page": "LOGIN",
                       "shipping_preference": "SET_PROVIDED_ADDRESS",
                       "user_action": "PAY_NOW",
                       "return_url": "https://elasticpath.com",
                       "cancel_url": "https://elasticpath.com"
		        }
	        }
        }
    }'
    ```

    The following response example is returned:

    `200 OK`

    ```
        "data": {
        "id": "4e772a38-7ca1-43a6-9c99-a136d2856bff",

                "currency": "USD",
                "formatted": "$100.00"
            },
            "display_refunded_amount": {
                "total": {
                    "amount": 0,
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "formatted": "$0.00"
                }
            },
            "timestamps": {
                "created_at": "2022-03-10T22:04:44Z",
                "updated_at": "2022-03-10T22:04:45Z"
            }
        },
        "client_parameters": {
            "token": "",
            "redirect_url": "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=4KT84175RH321931J"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Copy the `redirect_url` from the previous step and open in a browser. If you are not redirected to the personal account, sign in to the [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/) with your **Email ID** and **System Generated Password** or **Password** that you changed to. See [Accessing PayPal Developer Sandbox Accounts](/guides/How-To/paymentgateways/implement-paypal-express-checkout#accessing-paypal-developer-sandbox-accounts).
1. Click **Pay Now** to make the payment.

    You can see line item details such as item name, SKU, price, quantity, and taxes, and also order-level details such taxes, order total, and discounts corresponding to your payment request. See the following image as an example:

    ![PayPal example](/assets/SimplePayPalExample.png)

    :::note

    The maximum length of `name` and `sku` for an item is `127`. If `name` and `SKU` exceed `127`, we truncate the exceeding strings while sending order-level items to the PayPal payment gateway.
    
    :::

1. In postman, use the following request example to confirm the purchase.

    ```bash
       curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/orders/:orderId/transactions/:transactionId/confirm \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
            -d $'{
	           "data" : {
		       "gateway" : "paypal_express_checkout",
	      }
      }'
      ```

     The following response is returned:

    ```json

                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Go to Commerce Manager.
1. Go to **Orders**, and find the order. The payment status shows `Paid` and under the **Transaction**, the status shows `Complete`.

### `Authorization` workflow

1. Click **Pay Now** to make the payment. 

    You can see line item details such as item name, SKU, price, quantity, and taxes, and also order-level details such taxes, order total, and discounts corresponding to your payment request. See the following image:

1. In postman, use the following request example to confirm the payment.

    ```bash
       curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/orders/:orderId/transactions/:transactionId/confirm \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
            -d $'{
               "data" : {
               "gateway" : "paypal_express_checkout",
           }
       }'
      ```

    To confirm multiple payments in postman, update multiple payments settings in your PayPal account. See [Updating Multiple Payment Settings in PayPal](/guides/How-To/paymentgateways/implement-paypal-express-checkout#updating-multiple-payment-settings-in-paypal-account).

1. Capture the authorized funds. See [Capture a Transaction](/docs/api/carts/capture-a-transaction).
1. Go to Commerce Manager.
1. Go to **Orders**, and find the order. The payment status shows `Paid`, and the **Transaction** status shows `Complete`.

### `Refund` workflow
