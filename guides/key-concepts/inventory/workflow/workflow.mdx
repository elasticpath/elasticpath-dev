The order service first creates an [unpaid order](/guides/key-concepts/inventory/workflow/unpaidorder), which records the order details and holds the items. Once payment is completed, the order transitions to a [paid order](/guides/key-concepts/inventory/workflow/paidorder), allowing further processing, such as fulfillment or shipping.
