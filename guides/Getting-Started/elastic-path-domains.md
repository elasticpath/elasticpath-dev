Elastic Path supports multiple regions and each region has a unique hostname and base URL for API requests. Each Commerce store is assigned to a specific region, so all API requests related to the store must be made to the base URL for its assigned region. All sample requests in this document use the `https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/` base URL. Customers must substitute this URL with the correct base URL for their store when making API requests. Each customerâ€™s Commerce Commerce Manager home page provides the correct store base URL in the **API keys** > **API base URL** field.
