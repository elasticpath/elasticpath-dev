:::

While there is no limit on the number of SKUs, retrieving thousands of products on, for example, a “Show All Products” page for your store can cause system slow downs. If your queries are limited to smaller subsets of your products, the store’s performance stays within acceptable limits.

If you need higher quotas, please [contact us](https://www.elasticpath.com/contact-us) to discuss your plan, use cases, and requirements. We can increase quotas on a case-by-case basis.
